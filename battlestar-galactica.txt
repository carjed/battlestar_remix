narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
baltar: now you tell me you're a machine.
the robot.
you knew i wanted access to defence mainframe.
do you have any idea what they'd do to me if they find out?
no.
6: get down.
adama: moments ago, this ship received word that the cylon attack against our home worlds is underway.
as of this moment, we are at war.
all right, we can take three more people.
giving up my seat.
i've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.
so i'm in your head?
no.
there're maybe cylon agents living among us.
some may not even know they're cylons at all.
they could be sleeper agents programmed to perfectly impersonate human beings until activation.
and one minute to mark.
god has a plan for you, gaius. he has a plan for everything and everyone.
gaius?
are you even listening to me?  pilot: passengers, 30 seconds to mark.
roslin: planet.
men.
women.
age.
you know what?
do this after the jump.
it's all right.
you have to believe in something.
baltar: i believe in a world that i can and do understand.
a rational universe.
explained through rational means.
i love you.
that's not rational.
i know.
no, but you're not rational.
you're also not really here.
neither am i.  pilot: madam president, ladies and gentlemen our 33 minutes are almost up once again.
please prepare for our faster-than-light jump.
thank you.  cutting it a little close this time, aren't we, billy?
pilot says he's had to reboot the ftl computer again.
cally: why do the cylons come every 33 minutes?
why isn't it 34, 35 tyrol: cally.
cally: what?
shut up.
fifteen seconds.
sir, jump 237 underway.
fifty-three ships have jumped.
ten still reporting trouble with their ftl drives including colonial one.
we're getting slower.
maybe this time.
gaeta: dradis contact.
it's the cylons.
damn it.
not this time, maybe the next.
got another idea for the next cycle.
pilot: ladies and gentlemen, i'm afraid the cylons have appeared again.
however, our ftl drive is now working and we will jump momentarily.
baltar: five days now.
there are limits to the human body, the human mind.
tolerances that you can't push beyond.
well, those are facts provable facts.
everyone has a limit.
all right, you know the drill, people.
scatter formation.
apollo: keep them off the civies and don't stray beyond the recovery line.
watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
you've got a red light right there.
dualla: we have a hit on the starboard bow.
away the damage control parties.
basestar is launching raiders.
colonial one is ready to jump.
all civilian ships away, including colonial one.
recover fighters.
stand by to jump.
combat landings.
all fighters aboard, sir.
execute jump.
jump 237 complete.
all civilian ships present and accounted for, sir.
tigh: start the clock.
and let's start prep for the next jump.
clock is running.
thirty-three minutes.
mark.
tyrol: you have 32 minutes, people.
no.
6: you know you're not safe.
no, of course not. the cylons will follow us again as they have the last 237 times.
no.
6: you're right, you know.
there are limits.
eventually, you'll make a mistake.
and then you'll kill us all.
yes.
yes, i know.
but not for another 33 minutes.
adama: i want to try something new this time.
divide the fleet into six groups.
and they jump  adama: and they jump two more times and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates.
tigh: twenty-four jumps to plot, we're breaking our humps calculating one jump every 33 minutes.
get off my jacket.
you eating this? not anymore.
apollo: combat landings expected again to be the order of the day so double-check your undercarriage before look, you all have done this 237 times.
you know what to do.
no mistakes.
and let's make it to 238.
good luck and be careful out there.
can you do me a favour?
tell capt.
apollo he owes me one wing.
dave: you got it, dude.
no, cally, there's three.
i know there's three.
can you check it again for me, please?
yeah.
let's get some of them starting to work.
tyrol: we'll sleep when we're dead.
come on.
boomer.
heard the latest?
they say cylons look like us now.
primary fuel?
primary fuel 2893 krg.
marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on ragnar because they actually thought that he was a cylon.
you know what?
i don't give a frak.
red light on the number four thruster.
go make a visual id.
see if it's blocked.
right.
right.
a little rough on your new eco, don't you think?
he's not my eco.
he's some refugee from triton that i'm saddled with and i didn't ask you.
helo's gone, sharon.
i didn't ask you that, either.
sorry.
colony?
saggitaron.
how many have you got? socinus: we can't transmit photos yet.
if you want, you can leave them with us or you can put them on the board outside.
sorry.
dualla: thanks.
socinus: next.
socinus: colony?
update on the headcount, madam president.
how did we lose 300? there were some overcounts a few deaths from wounds and a few missing during the last attack.
do you want children, gaius?
let me think about it for a minute.
no.
procreation is one of god's commandments.
really?
i'm sure some day if you're a good cylon he'll reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own.
i want us to have a child, gaius.
baltar: you can't be serious.
it's dr.
amarak.
what was that?
i'm so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking.
you were just saying?
i was just saying that a dr.
amarak has requested to speak with the president.
dr.
amarak.
i see.
you know him?
have you always been able to multitask like this? yes.
i used to work with him at the ministry of defence. it says here that he's uncovered important information regarding how the cylons were able to defeat colonial defences.
i was always a little worried he was on to us.
were you going to speak to him?
baltar: perhaps i should speak to him if you're busy.
billy: i think he wanted to speak directly with the president.
it sounded urgent.
it must be very important.
maybe something about a certain traitor in the president's inner circle?
there's not enough time before we jump.
i want him on board first thing during the next cycle.
thank you, doctor.
i'd say you have a serious problem.
lf i can help.
he's a strange one, isn't he?            man:  landing base team alpha, check three.
dualla: can you see it?
twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
that makes 61.
have the docs start pum them up with stimulants and get them back on the line.
adama: pilots, too.
dualla: fuel report.
one out of every three, every other cycle.
tigh: that's gonna come back and bite us on the ass.
adama: we have too much work and not enough people to do it.
dualla: fuel report.
i've already signed one of these.
yes, sir.
i'm sorry, sir.
comm traffic two from the president. is this my 10 minutes or this yours?
yours.
i took 10 last time.
see you guys in combat.
i believe it was your 10 minutes.
if the old man's so tired he can't remember, then it's his turn.
you see the note from the xo? yeah, i saw it.
no way.
apollo: kara, everyone else starbuck: i don't fly with stims.
they blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
come on, kara, give me a break.
just why are we arguing about this? apollo: i have no idea.
neither do i.
you're the cag, act like one.
what the hell does that mean? it means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend.
we're not friends, you're the cag.
be careful out there? our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot cylons out of the frakking sky.
starbuck: good hunting is what you say.
and now, one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills.
so she either says, yes, sir and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those pills.
well, i'm glad i'm not working for you.
you're damn right you're glad.
so, do i have to smack you in the mouth, lieutenant?
no, sir.
i'll take my pills.
perfect.
carry on.
yes, sir.
dispatcher: pilots to ready room for pre-flight briefing.
pilots to ready room.
what?
jump 238 complete.
adama: start the clock.
gaeta:  thirty-three minutes.
mark.
all civilian ships present and  strike my last.
one civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir.
tigh: which one? dualla: the olympic carrier.
dualla: commercial passenger vessel.
adama: were they left behind?
dualla: i think i accounted for all civilian ships before we left.
you think?
did you or didn't you?
they're not logged in, sir.
i think they may have been left behind.
how many people aboard ship?
you're telling me we left over 1,300 people to die at the hands of the cylons? it may not have been her fault, sir. it may have been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates or the cylons destroyed the ship before the jump or 50 other things may have happened.
the point is we don't know what the hell did happen.
yes, we're tired.
yes, there's no relief.
yes, the cylons keep coming after us time after time and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs.
we make mistakes, people die.
there aren't many of us left.
carry on.
okay.
next crisis?
list of calls?
yes.
but first, where's the doctor who's supposed to be on board?
what's his name?
dr.
amarak.
yes.
dr.
amarak.
oh. he was on the olympic carrier.
no.
6: god is watching out for you, gaius.
the universe is a vast and complex system.
coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur.
indeed they are to be expected.
it's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
dr.
amarak posed a threat to you.
now he's gone.
logic says there's a connection.
baltar: a connection, maybe.
but not god.
there is no god or gods, singular or plural.
there are no large invisible men, or women for that matter in the sky taking a personal interest in the fortunes of gaius baltar.
be careful.
that which god gives, he can also take away.
fifteen seconds.
maybe this time.
dradis?
no enemy contacts.
keep the clock running.
what do you think?
i think we wait.
get me the president.
why this time?
was it something that you did? we had a new plan, but we didn't have time to implement it yet.
we lost a ship during the last cycle, the olympic carrier.
does that have something to do with it?
adama: possibly.
are you there?
yeah, i'm here.
what do we do now, commander?
i've got people on the verge over here.
we're gonna go to condition two.
we have to take advantage of this time and let our people get some rest.
all right.
and how long do we stay at condition two? until i'm satisfied they're not going to return.
adama: it's a military decision.
it is.
i know that.
you're right and i defer to your decision.
and, commander let your men and women know how grateful i am for the job that they are doing, please.
thank them for me.
adama: thank you, madam president.
adama: thank you. adama: contact apollo.
adama: tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet and order his other pilots to land immediately.
all right, people, you heard the order.
boomer, starbuck, form up with me.
we'll fly the first cap.
apollo: i want everyone else back on galactica and in their racks.
apollo: three-hour rotation.
starbuck: hey, apollo not that i'm not honoured by being chosen to sit in my cockpit for the next three hours but apollo: but why you? take a guess.
because i'm on drugs?
you got it.
this patrol is 100% stimulated.
crashdown: anyone else feels like they've got frakking ants crawling behind their eyeballs?
apollo: how about you, boomer?
doc tells me you're holding up better than anybody in the squadron.
boomer: i'm tired like everybody else.
apollo: you never seem it.
starbuck: because she's a cylon.
you're gonna make me come over there and kick your ass.
okay.
let's set up a patrol here before somebody gets hurt.
apollo: follow me.
starbuck: copy that, apollo.
a couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet tigh: right about now.
adama: you deserve it.
thank you. the truth is all this has me feeling more alive than i have in years.
you look that way, too.
it's good to you without the cup in your hand.
don't start.
i know there's a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you weren't feeling as good as you were.
if the crew doesn't hate the xo, then he's not doing his job.
besides, got to make the old man look good.
i always look good.
did you look in a mirror?
seriously gaeta: sir.
it's one thing to push a crew, it's another to break them.
dradis contact.
bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.
getting recognition signal.
man: initiating response flash mode.
alpha, alpha.
it's the olympic carrier, sir.
adama: is that confirmed?
dualla: it's confirmed, sir.
thank the gods.
action stations.
put the fleet into condition one.
i want all vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes.
tigh: mr.
gaeta.
gaeta: sir? restart the clock.
thirty-three minutes.
hope you're wrong.
so do i.
gaeta: clock is running.
adama: so do i.
no.
it's all wrong.
if they were left behind, why didn't the cylons destroy them? and why are they showing up now? it's god's punishment for your lack of faith.
that's just great, that is. a more logical and useful explanation, please.
all right.
the olympic carrier has been infiltrated by cylon agents.
they've been tracking the ship all along.
no. then that means logically, in order for you to survive the olympic carrier should be destroyed.
boomer: olympic carrier this is raptor 478, call sign boomer.
i have you in visual contact.
please respond to this channel.
over.
man: raptor 478, this is the olympic carrier.
we have you in visual contact.
thank the lords of kobol.
you don't know how relieved we are to see you.
boomer: roger that, olympic carrier.
can i ask about your whereabouts?
man: we had trouble with our ftl drive.
took us almost three hours to fix.
adama: have boomer ask them how they escaped the cylons.
boomer: olympic carrier, boomer.
i've been directed to ask how you escaped from the cylons.
man: they were closing in on us when the rest of you were jum.
i thought we were goners, then they just broke off.
someone must've been watching out for us.
boomer: roger that.
man: one other thing, boomer.
i've got a dr.
amarak on board who has an urgent matter to discuss with the president.
he's been driving me crazy.
can you be more specific?
man: i can't. he says he knows something about a traitor in our midst and he's unwilling to share more than that.
madam president, i strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away.
why? look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? the olympic carrier is still flying because the cylons let them survive.
they've been tracking that ship all along.
there's probably a cylon agent aboard now! calm down.
start over.
please, madam president, i implore you.
listen to me.
cut off radio communication with that ship before they send.
previously on battlestar galactica.
this planet is kobol, the birthplace of mankind.
organize a ground survey team.
three raptors.
they're everywhere!
get us out of here!
pull it up!
get down!
galactica.
apollo, starbuck just jumped away, if you go back to caprica,,, and bring me the arrow, it will show us the way to earth,  starbuck?
adama i'm terminating your presidency,,, as of this moment, tigh i am placing you under arrest, madam president.
this is mutiny.
you know that.
no, come, see the face of the shape of things to come, isn't she beautiful, gaius?
i'm not a cylon.
this isn't happening.
cylon boomer you can't fight destiny, sharon, it catches up with you, no matter what you do,   man make a hole!
apollo where are the medics?
where's doc cottle?
lshay off-ship, on rounds in the fleet, sir.
stand clear!
fischer pressure.
sgt.
fischer reporting, sir.
man you got it?
fischer pressure!
yeah.
it's lodged too far.
i'm calling for him.
fischer he's gotta be drugged.
man he's gotta be aggressive.
what's the status on the bleeding?
fischer let's go.
man are we supposed to do that here, though?
fischer no, we're gonna get him into med bay as soon as possible.
i'm your new shipmate.
bill adama.
saul tigh.
we've got tension pneumo.
i'm gonna stick him and release the pressure.
fischer he's gonna be okay.
what's going on?
what happened?
sergeant of the s, secure that thing in the brig.
aye, sir.
hollis, wenzler, let's go! let's go!  no! boomer no! wait! lshay okay, he's breathing.
boomer i didn't do anything!
let's get him down to sickbay, rfn.
boomer no! valerii shot the old man.
kelly what?
boomer three-one.
gaeta she must be a cylon.
the colonel's in command.
you're second.
lshay make a hole!
boomer no! fischer sergeant, secure capt.
adama.
put him in the brig!
colonel!
col.
tigh!  let's go! apollo i didn't do it!
he's my father!
colonel!
colonel!
kelly colonel.
could this be a prelude to a cylon attack?
how would they know where we are?
racetrack valerii could have told them, sir.
what?
how? when we were aboard the base star she left the raptor for a few minutes and came back without her helmet.
she might have told the cylons everything, our position, defenses.
kelly colonel, the toasters have knocked out our co.
this has gotta be part of a bigger plan.
i recommend we execute jump to emergency standby coordinates.
colonel, i've located doc cottle.
he's aboard the rising star,  gaeta dradis.
single contact!
cylon base star, bearing 487-carom-015! sir, we can't stay here.
sir! adama so what's your plan here?
personally, i tend to go with what you know till something better turns up, kelly sir! dee, alert the fleet.
we are making an immediate jump to the emergency coordinates.
go! sir, doc cottle is still he'll have to rejoin us on the other side of the jump.
sir, what about our people on the surface of kobol?
if they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
gaeta ftl! dualla go.
navcon?
go.
galactica to all vessels.
prepare to make immediate ftl jump to escape coordinates alpha.
i say again, escape coordinates alpha.
clock will start on my mark.
mark!
captain, what have they done to you? what's going on?
my father's been shot.
what?
someone get this frakking thing off me, please?
i'm not authorized to do that yet.
i'm behind the frakking bars! captain how bad is your father?
bad.
two bullets in the chest.
is dr.
cottle with him?
no.
doc cottle's not on board.
dualla attention, galactica, fleet is away.
stand by to jump in five, four three, two, one jump!
gaeta jump completed.
report.
report!
dradis is empty.
no contacts.
no contacts?
where's the fleet?
dee! checking all channels.
no colonial signals.
they're gone, sir.
no, isn't she beautiful, gaius?
i don't think i've ever been touched so deeply in my entire life.
you're going to make a wonderful father.
speaking metaphorically, of course.
and literally.
she's our child, gaius.
our little girl.
what?
do you want to hold her?  yes.
yes, of course i do.
but she's not real any more than any of this is real.
she's real.
she is? she may not be with you yet, but she will be.
soon.
i'm having a little difficulty.
i'm trying to understand.
i want to understand.
i. you're the mother.
and you're the father.
am i the father?
excuse me? dream.
i'm clearly having a dream.
we're moving out, sir.
get up.
and if you wouldn't mind carrying something this time, that would be great.
this is serisone.
it should help you breathe a little easier.
tyrol take it easy.
you'll be up, feeling better, in a few minutes.
excuse me, sir.
we've got to get you up.
crewman specialist socinus it hurts.
i know.
if you don't mind me asking, where are we going, crashdown?
tree line.
we can hide but still see the crash site, in case galactica sends a rescue party.
galactica will be sending a rescue party.
crashdown everybody down!
cally what was that? that cylons?
seelix, grab the ammo.
staggered formation, i'll take point.
chief, you're bringing up the rear.
be ready to double-time it, people!
one, two, three!
el-tee, i think we should double-check the supplies before we bug out.
sorry, chief, we don't have the time.
if that's an aircraft turbine, they're gonna be on us any moment!
el-tee, we've gotta make sure we have everything!
we don't have the time, chief!
damn it.
gods damn it.
what's going on, saul?
where's the fleet?
we don't know.
they jumped to another location.
you've got blood on your .
why would they do that?
every watch, we update our emergency jump calculations with new star fixes to compensate for inertial drift.
and then we transmit them to the rest of the fleet.
this time, ours were updated, but theirs weren't.
gaeta was supposed to transmit them to the rest of the fleet.
so it's gaeta's fault.
the kid was overwhelmed.
he had his hands full.
if you say so. it sounds like a pretty big screw-up to me.
i should have checked before i gave the order to jump! this doesn't sound like you, saul.
you don't let people slide.
you bust their ass.
now if bill doesn't make it-- he'll make it.
if he doesn't, this will be your ship.
your command.
all i'm saying is you need to be-- this is bill adama's ship.
this is his command.
his orders are still the word of the gods on this ship.
just so we're clear.
this will be adama's command until the day he dies.
and we are not going to let him die.
so say we all.
all so say we all.
as you were.
so how do we find the fleet?
if we jump back to our original coordinates our nav computers can use those star fixes to generate a best-fit solution giving the fleet's current position.
the cylons are waiting for us back there.
how long will it take to calculate once we get back there?
if we shut down all other functions there's no way we can hold off a cylon base star for 12 hours.
we have got to jump back.
we can't stay here.
lt. thrace won't be able to find us once she retrieves the arrow from caprica.
if she retrieves the arrow.
she'll retrieve the arrow.
captain, you've got to get reinstated.
you've got to get back to clc.
you've got to denounce me, disavow me, do whatever you need to do.
col.
tigh cannot relocate this fleet on his own without your father.
tigh's not letting me out of here.
i put a gun to his head.
he won't forget that anytime soon.
i am so sorry that i got you into this, captain.
no, don't apologize.
i knew what i was doing.
i. and i didn't do it for you.
i did it for.
well, actually, i did it for nothing, turns out.
that's not true.
you took a stand.
and now look at us.
tyrol watch your foot.
seelix okay.
everyone take five.
give me the med kit.
where's the med kit? how you doing?
hey, how you doing, buddy?
good.
just listening to the birds.
i'll be damned.
i don't remember the last time i heard birds.
take it easy, okay?
damn it.
we're out of serisone.
tarn, get the other med kit.
what other med kit? don't frakking tell me.
we pulled two med kits from the ship.
i told you to keep an eye on both of them.
i only saw the one, sir.
there were two! i'm sorry, sir, but i don't remember you telling me-- well, i did! sir, his lungs are filling up with fluid.
if he doesn't get more serisone soon, he's not gonna make it.
okay.
all right, tarn.
you forgot the med kit, so you're gonna have to go back and get it.
take a rifle, three clips of ammo, and a canteen.
what?
move.
cally, come here.
watch the rear.
el-tee, you can't send him alone.
you questioning my orders, chief?
no, i'm just pointing out a flaw in your plan. it doesn't need to be anything bigger than that.
cally and i can go with him.
all right, fine.
but would you look out for cally?
cally, give me the rifle.
we three go.
leave that, leave your backpack.
sidearms out.
tarn, you're bringing up the rear. in the middle, eyes and ears.
her consciousness is being downloaded into another body right now. and when she wakes up, she'll tell them exactly where we are.
she's right.
we can't stay here.
she's right, huh? sharon the cylon is right.
let's all just listen to sharon the cylon do whatever she says, 'cause that's a good idea.
hey, kara, she helped me get this far.
okay, i get it.
i get it, helo.
you and i go way back, so i get it.
all right, i remember how you felt about her. but that is not the real sharon.
that is some cheap knock-off copy.
i'm not a copy.
i'm sharon.
i remember the first day i met you, starbuck.
you were puking your guts out in the head because you'd eaten bad oysters on-- don't do that.
hey! i don't like it, and i don't like you.
so the best thing you can do is just keep your damn mouth shut.
starbuck, put it down, for gods' sakes.
what do you want from me, helo?
she's a cylon.
you've been had.
we've been had.
so what, i'm just supposed to be nice to her because she says she's pregnant?
get out of the way.
no.
karl, do not think that i will not shoot-- i'm not gonna let you kill her! okay?
she's carrying my child!
my gods, men are so painfully stupid sometimes!
how do you know that?
i know, all right?
she's not lying.
they lie about everything, helo.
their entire existence is a lie.
they're not human, helo.
they're machines.
you can't have a baby with a machine!
i don't know what to tell you, okay? but i believe her.
it's hard to describe.
we've been together a long time.
i mean, i know what she is, but she is not like the others.
she is not.
no, no, no, no, no! bitch took my ride.
crew member yeah, go ahead.
how's he doing?
well, the bullets tore up his spleen.
his blood pressure is way down.
somebody needs to get in there and stop the bleeding or we'll lose him.
adama so what's your plan?
tigh don't really have one, i'm getting back in the cockpit.
i'm getting back into my fleet.
adama i want you to come with me, saul, you really believe that we can get back in the fleet?
yeah, i do.
adama yeah, i do, how long until doc cottle's aboard?
i don't know.
it's gonna be a while.
he doesn't have much time, sir.
you're gonna have to go in yourself.
me? i'm just a medic.
today, you're a doctor.
colonel.
tigh open the cell.
how's the commander?
you've bungled the job, if that's what you're asking.
then he's alive.
thank the gods.
how many of our pilots were cylons?
i don't know.
who gave the order to shoot the old man?
no one.
just get it over with, you frakking coward!
give me your sidearm!
give me your gun! yes, sir.
just shoot me.
get it over with.
tyrol hey, tarn.
go up, take a look.
if it's not there, it's at the raptor.
we'll have to move up more.
i got it, chief.
tyrol all right, let's get the hell out of here.
tarn on point.
let's go! go, go, go, go, go.
cally this makes no sense.
why am i carrying the med kit when you forgot it?
first of all, that's the el-tee's kit.
secondly, i'm on point.
whatever.
all right, children, that's enough.
tell you what, cally.
if it makes you feel any better i'll put him on hangar deck mop-up duty with you for the next week.
cally now you're talking.
tarn for what? if anybody should have mop duty, it's the el-tee.
tyrol go! go! get down!
top of the ridge!
cally!
take the rifle and cover me! drastic fire!  okay, okay.
wait for me.
wait for me, all right?
go! go! go! stay there!

i'm gonna check you right now.
i'm gonna put him here, cal.

lay down.
you're gonna stay right here, okay?
i'm gonna check you right now.
let's just try.
it's not that bad.
it's not that bad.
cally, check the ridge.
i wanna go home.
i know.
i know.
we're going home.
we're going home, okay?

cally chief?
chief, we gotta go.
we gotta go.
chief?
gods damn this stupid frakked-up crap!  chief, socinus needs us now.
come on.
come on.
let's go.
not your fault, lieutenant.
not from where i was standing.
i was the ood. it was crazy in there, sir.
you can't blame yourself.
so, we jump back to the last coordinates but we network the ftl computer with the nav, dc, and fire control computers.
once they're linked, we'll only need 10 minutes to complete the calculations.
you can't be serious.
the old man would never do this, colonel.
kelly no computer networks on his ship.
i acknowledge that, sir.
but i can devise a software firewall that will buy us more time.
really?
you're going to out-think the cylons at computer software?
sir, if we don't do this, we're never gonna find the fleet.
certainly not before the commander dies.
this is still the old man's command.
we can't do something he'd oppose especially when it puts the entire ship at risk.
this is the xo.
begin jump prep.
those are my orders.
the kid is back in the fleet!
bill, let's have the truth.
so how did you do it?
how'd you get off this frakking freighter?
connections.
anne's father has a friend on the defense subcommittee.
so the new wife comes through.
i wish i had in-laws with pull.
give me a couple of years.
i'll have some pull.
you watch me.
i'll have my own battlestar one day.
open up, please.
all right.
you have my parole.
when i'm on duty, i'll make no attempt to free her or sow insurrection among the crew.
when i'm not on duty, i'll report directly back to this cell.
pre-flight brief is underway in the ready room.
right.
roslin good hunting, captain.
thank you, madam president.
colonel, once you find the fleet, i'd like to have a word with you.
there's nothing to talk about.
you went up against the old man and you lost.
we jump in, we hold off the cylons we crunch the numbers, and we jump out.
that's it.
simple plan.
not so simple to do.
computers have been networked.
the board is green, sir.
all stations report ready to jump.
crew member ftl go! that software firewall ready?
best i can make it, sir.
i wish dr.
baltar was here.
to hell with that.
i'll take your work over that shifty son of a bitch any day.

the battery units are at the aid stations.
well, then get me a knife.
weapons free, and open racks and engage!
pilot viper two-one, i'm right behind your tail, here it comes.
the cylons are hacking our network.
they're attempting to access our gateway.
now it's a race.
pilot we've got three more, spike that, spike that, we have four more, gaeta first firewall penetrated.
apollo sierra-alpha, we got a new bogey, hotdog what is that thing?
i don't know, but whatever it is, it's bearing on galactica.
we've got to take it out!
apollo, hotdog, defensive, three right, five at two, tally, hotdog!
kat, on me! kat roger that, i'm with you, leader, will you pray with me? help us, lords of kobol.
help your prophet, laura, guide us to the path of righteousness that we might.
that we might destroy our enemies.
let us walk the path of righteousness,,,  and lift our faces unto your goodness, help us turn away from the calls of the wicked,,, and show us the knowledge of your certain salvation, we offer this prayer,,,,  gaeta calculations at 56%. second firewall's been breached!
apollo damn it!
gaeta frak, they're fast.

frak! frak! apollo damn it!

tigh break the network!
pilot hang tight, sure can, gentleman, sure can, network is broken!
computers restored to local control!

sgt.
watkins, sir.
open up, please.
maj.
adama's compliments.
he wishes me to inform you, you've been reinstated in the colonial fleet with the rank of captain.
maj.
adama?
welcome back to the fleet, sir.
i'll be right with you, sergeant.
yes, sir.
you never should've brought me back in the service.
if you'd just let me be, i'd have died back there on caprica along with everyone else and been happier for it.
i don't want a command.
i never did.
don't you dare die on me now.
.
previously on battlestar galactica i think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple.
maybe it was a road sign on the path to earth. it was on the temple.
where'd you get the idea to paint yours? it was just something i've been doodling since i was a kid, i liked the pattern.
starbuck, you're getting too low.
come on, lee.
get her out of there.
you come back!
just let me go.
they're waiting for me.
no! gaius baltar, after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal finds you not guilty.
get him back!
get him out of here!
gaius, it's okay.
come with me.
where are you taking me to? to your new life.
come.

sir, all fleet ships were powered down during the outage.
it'll take at least 20 min to spool up the ftl drives.
we just don't have 20 minutes.
action stations.
set condition throughout the ship.
this is not a drill.
all viper pilots report to vipers immediately.
i have a bogey at my ten.
i'm gonna go check it out.
what the frak?! hi, lee.
kara?
i've been to earth.
i know where it is.
and i'm gonna take us there.
no, this is frakkin' crazy.
i saw your ship blow up.
afraid not.
did you not hear me? i've been to earth.
earth.
big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds.
you're gonna love it.
i promise.
identify that ship immediately.
sir, i'm checking for colonial recognition codes.
get lee online!
i'm trying, sir.
i'm picking up her ship's signature.
that's her voice.
hold on.
it is not real.
it is a trick.

admiral, it's a cylon trick.
the vipers have stopped the main cylon thrust, but the reserves have broken through.
i want everything that can fly up there immediately.
saul.
saul! what the hell is wrong with you? nothing, bill.
never felt better in my life.
colonel tigh! i gave you an order.
everybody that's ever held a stick, i want them up there now.
get 'em out! put 'em up there!
sir.
attention.
this is the xo.
let's go! get that bird in the tube.
get that showboat bird in the tube.
where the frak are these nuggets?
mama's not gonna save you today!
let's go! you want to fly or not?
ready or not, let's go.
hey, this is crazy.
what if another switch flips in my head and turns me against my own?
shut the frak up.
it's like the colonel said, okay?
just think of that.
be the man you want to be till the day you die.
easier said than done, i don't know what the frak i am right now.
you're samuel t. anders.
that's all you gotta remember.
now get the frak in your ship.
who else would he be?
hey, rook.
stay cool out there, all right?
you'll lock in and do what you've been trained to do.
it's just like suiting up for a championship game, right?
yeah, that's right.
good hunting.
if she didn't notice anything, maybe the other cylons won't either.
yeah, well, don't wait to find out.
shoot first.
get the frak in there.
go kill something.
let's go! let's load these birds!
anders, get the frak in your viper!
where are you taking me? it's a place we found.
an unused compartment.
sir, we've lost pyxis!
oh, my gods.
captain tarney.
how did they find us?
that's the question, isn't it?
base ships launching missiles.
half targeted on us, half on the fleet.
have triple-a target only missiles going towards the fleet.
we can handle the hits.
they can't.
sir.
all forces, priority intercept enemy missiles targeting civilian vessels.
i am samuel t. anders.
i was born on picon.
i went to noyce elementary school.
get your thumb off the transmit button.
you're blocking the freq.
copy that.
frak me.
longshot, hardball.
turkey, right four low at three, committing.
longshot, i got the tally, i got your back.
seelix, there's a raider on you! shoot, anders!
i'm trying to.
gods, come on!
sir, the cylon strike force has just turned back to their ships.
base ships are spinning up.
they're pulling out.
we're gonna do the same damn thing before they change their mind.
have fighters cover our withdrawal.
yes, sir.
all fighters assume rear cover formation.
they had us.
game over.
why the hell did they let us go? maybe something's changed.
like what? i have no idea, madame president.
no idea.
battlestar galactica season - episode transcript = swsub.com
- thanks, insults, appreciations = lords of kobol - you'll be safe here, gaius.
right.
chief, i'm gonna need you to develop my gun camera footage asap.
i've got a hell of a set of vacation pictures.
i'll take my post-flight checklist.
i want to sign out so i can get in the showers.
i don't have one for you.
what's up? okay.
okay, me too.
it's okay, it's okay.
do you believe in miracles?
no.
i told everyone that you were too frakkin' mean to kill.
okay, i'm okay, i'm okay.
i'm okay.
what the hell are you doing in a jock smock?
i just finished viper transition a week ago, and i started acm.
how the starbuck!
i did it, boss.
i found earth.
everybody move back.
hit their post.
move in.
step away!
i need you in sickbay.
cottle's gonna give you a complete physical examination.
what's going on?
i'm off the ship for a few hours and a few hours?
kara, you were gone for over two months.
that's impossible.
my ship's clock reads six hours and change.
then your clock's wrong, kara.
sam's telling you the truth.
we thought you were dead.
what?
gaius, i just wanted you to know that we'll be back soon.
whatever you do, please don't go anywhere by yourself.
it's not safe.
tracey's here for anything you need.
we'll be back as soon as we've looked in on derek.
okay?
right oh, derek.
that's your little boy, isn't it?
the one in sickbay.
right.
yes, i i'm praying for his recovery.
really?
yeah.
oh, thank you. it's a pleasure.
thank you. so what's the game plan, ladies?
game plan?
well, this place is brilliant, really.
you know, it's beautiful.
just when am i getting out of here?
when i am getting off the ship?
well, security's too tight.
besides besides what?
you're just trying to keep me here and none of the other ships will have you.
we'll be back.
yesterday, you were facing execution.
today you're free.
why the long face?
oh, gee, i don't know.
from president of the colonies to this.
king of fools.
probably best to be hated by everyone than loved by this lot.
doomed to live out the rest of my life in this loony bin.
i don't know, that might have something to do with my rather savage mood swings.
relax, gaius.
you think i've brought you this far just to let it end here?
i need some encouragement.
a ray of hope about the future.
an inkling you've got me.
i'm here for you.
that is so beautiful.
hello.
sorry, what? the way you were praying.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, thank you, yeah.
not some hollow ritual.
no, no.
it's as if the gods are right here beside you.
well, yeah.
when i pray to the gods, i feel empty.
do you?
that's a shame, isn't it?
her gods are false.
tell her.
well, if you feel empty when you pray to zeus or poseidon or aphrodite, it's because it is empty.
it's a totally empty experience.
they're they're not real.
they've been promulgated by a ruling elite to stop you from learning the truth.
and what truth is that?
that's a very good question.
what is the the there's only one god.
there is only one god. in a nutshell, that's the truth.
we're alone here, aren't we? the others aren't coming back soon.
and the door's locked.
all right, good.
can you feel god's presence?
you know what?
i think i do.
so do i.
do you?
do you too? we both we both feel so what's cottle's verdict?
everything checks out.
so i'm me, not a cylon?
that is why you had me tested, right?
kara, nobody said you were cylon.
but you were thinking it.
we had to be sure, kara.
fair enough.
let's go through it again.
how many times do you want to hear it?
as many times as it takes to make sense.
i followed a raider into the storm.
took some hits, passed out.
when i came to, i was orbiting this planet.
its yellow moon and star matches the description in pythia.
i took these pictures in orbit.
the star patterns match what we saw in the tomb of athena.
how did you get here?
i told you, i don't know exactly.
well, that's just not good enough, captain.
tell us everything you remember.
i remember taking the photos.
turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.
and then i'm not sure.
i must've blacked out again.
i remember a giant gas planet with rings.
i remember a flashing triple star.
and a comet.
and then i was back with the fleet.
and for you, all of this took six hours.
i do not understand the time discrepancy either, okay?
all i know is i was there.
i took the pictures.
i didn't imagine it!
i had my crew clean it up.
there's not a ding or a scratch on it.
it's got the same tail number as the one she flew out on.
but i've been fixing up that old bird since day one, and this thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
so it's not the same ship.
unless she found a hell of a body shop out there, no, ma'am, it's not.
admiral, it's just not the outside either.
this is the data from the nav computer.
there isn't any.
it's blank.
there's no record of where this ship has been.
okay.
put her in the brig.
what?
so some things don't add up, and we're back to thinking she's a cylon?
what about cottle's test?
cottle's test doesn't prove anything.
even if her dna's the same, she could still be a cylon.
she could've been one from the beginning.
baltar's cylon detector was a crock.
it failed to i.d.
boomer.
i know how you feel about her, bill, but that is exactly what the cylons could be counting on here.
we're back where we started from.
could be cylons right here, we wouldn't know till they put a bullet in our head.
or lead us into an ambush.
that cylon fleet had enough firepower to blow us out of the sky, but instead they ran and jumped.
and there's kara thrace suddenly back from the dead having found earth.
if kara thrace can lead us off our course course?
what course? the nebula was supposed to be another clue on the way to earth, but it the nebula is only a road sign along the way to earth.
and we need to continue to follow its path.
well, what if kara is the clue that we were supposed to find? and what if she's playing you? and what if she's playing you? and all of us? gaius, please!
gaius, please, can you help me?
what's going on?
oh, god watch his head.
it's derek.
derek, is it?
derek, i see.
where are my clothes?
it's okay.
is it?
did they give you a diagnosis?
they said he's got viral encephalitis.
viral?
i don't know, it's some inflammation of the brain.
can't the doctors do something?
well, not if it's viral, no.
i'm afraid it's up to derek's immune system.
and he has to be strong.
and we have to be strong for him.
i didn't want him to die in that sickbay, so so i brought him here.
so he can be with us.
all of us.
yeah, all of us.
give me your hand, please.
i wish there was you know i prayed for him, don't you?
i know.
i prayed for him.
i know.
i guess i guess that the one true god just doesn't want him to live, right?
anybody still hearing that frakkin' song?
nope.
maybe it stopped when we figured out who what we are.
could have been some kind of trigger? to switch us on?
you know, after that raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
they all did.
you think it recognized you as a cylon?
i don't know.
maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
more important, why didn't i shoot him?
racetrack was right.
you just made a dumb nugget mistake.
did i? maybe i was programmed to leave my gun safeties on.
those bastards can't program me to help them.
no way.
boomer thought the same thing.
and then she shot the old man.
boomer didn't know what she was.
we do.
that is not gonna happen.
agreed?
i don't know why i'm here.
yes, i do.
i'm here because of the things that we've shared and the things that we've seen the visions in the opera house.
you went inside.
you saw more than i did.
i thought that maybe you could help me.
help you how? i need to know about the other five.
the types we've never seen.
the ones that baltar calls the final five.
and you want to know if kara thrace is one of them.
yes.
i've been programmed never to think about them.
well, your programming isn't working, because you're thinking about them right now.
i try not to.
trying not to is thinking about them.
how do you rationalize that?
all right, no.
back off.
don't leave, back off.
the five are close.
what?
i can feel them.
what about this one?
it's a protoplanetary system.
so? nothing but rocks.
no ringed gas giants like you claimed you saw.
i did see it, lieutenant.
if you say so, sir.
and what are you saying, mr.
gaeta?
i'm not saying anything, sir.
i'm just following orders.
well, i'm ordering you to help me.
you're ordering me mr.
gaeta, take a break.
with pleasure, sir.
jump clock is running, dee.
take us out of here.
yes, sir.
what's going on?
i see it on his face.
on all of their faces.
they don't believe me.
you want people to believe you? find that star system.
it's a big waste of time.
we've only been at it a few hours.
found maybe a dozen trinaries.
baltar's calculations took months.
it doesn't work like that.
how does it work, kara?
it's a feeling.
an intuition.
i didn't use nav fixes to get there and back.
when we were at that nebula, it was so clear to me.
but every jump we take farther away, the clarity fades.
if we keep jum like this, i won't be able to find our way back.
that'll be all.
all hands, prepare for jump in ten the president's adamant.
we're gonna continue on the course laid out by the eye of jupiter.
five, four, three, two, jump.
we're going the wrong way.
if we keep jum, i'll lose the feeling completely and i'll never be able to take us back.
what do you want me to do? you want me to go to laura roslin, tell her forget pythia and the eye of jupiter, because kara has some feeling about where earth is? yes.
i can't.
i just left your ship.
there's not a scratch on it.
it's brand-new.
how do you explain that, kara?
look at me. look at me! i swear to gods it's me, kara.
i can do this.
you said you loved me like a daughter.
if you still do, you've gotta trust me on this one.
i can't afford to.
they're waiting for me.
no! no! they're waiting for me.
no! no! what should i believe?
should i believe my heart?
or my eyes?
well, you know where i stand.
i want to believe her. but the president's right.
it's exactly what the cylons would be counting on.
so i guess you're not changing course.
for the time being, we follow the president's lead.
she's still staying in your quarters?
just till we find a place to put her up, to finish the rest of her doloxan treatment.
i want to thank you for suiting up during the fight.
we needed everyone up there.
we still do.
i took those off for the wrong reasons.
put them back on.
baltar's trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling i've been having for a while.
it's time for a change.
i need to move on.
i've had some feelers from the government.
there's a position opening up.
and i think i can make a valuable contribution there.
maybe even more than in the cockpit.
dad, what if zak had come back to us in that viper?
if my brother had climbed out of that cockpit would it matter if he were a cylon?
if he always had been?
when all's said and done would that change how we really feel about him?
please, god.
i'm only asking you this one last time.
don't let this child die.
has he sinned against you? he can't have sinned against you.
he's not even had a life yet.
how can you take him and let me live? after all i've done.
really, if you want someone to suffer, take me.
we both know i deserve it.
i have been selfish and weak.
i have failed so many people.
and i have killed.
i'm not asking for your forgiveness.
i'm just asking that you spare the life of this innocent child.
don't take him.
take me.
take me, take me please.
we were all very moved by the way you prayed for derek.
fat lot of good it did him.
unfortunately, he's worse, if you hadn't realized.
doesn't mean god didn't hear you.
i'm sure he's looking after derek's immortal soul.
yes, i wish i shared your confidence on that one.
i really do.
but you have to keep the faith.
we all look to you for guidance well, you shouldn't, should you?
i mean, you're just well, you're very young and what are we doing here exactly?
thank you. mr.
president.
gaius, let's go.
we should get back, okay?
good to see you again.
i'm sorry.
i can't we met at the groundbreaking ceremony on new caprica.
introduced you to my son kevin. he told you he wanted to be president when he grew up.
you told him that he could be if he stuck to his schoolwork.
he's a redhead little boy, isn't he? about eight or nine years old seven.
seven years old.
how is kevin.
how is he? he's dead.
your police shot him.
come on, gaius, let's get out of here.
leave her alone!
look at me! leave her alone!
look at me! go on, scream.
come on, scream!
i want to see if anyone comes to help you.
scream!
beg.
i bet you begged the cylons.
why don't you beg for me? come on, beg! get up!
get on your knees!
get up!
you asked god to take your life instead of the boy's.
did you mean it?
yes.
do it.
take my life.
please.
please.
please take my life.
you see? gaius, i knew god wouldn't desert you.
i felt his love course through me, giving me the strength to smite them.
less smiting next time, unless you want to be held up on murder charges.
gaius!
you two, watch the door.
are you all right?
i cut myself shaving.
well, you have to come.
you have to come and see derek.
derek?
derek, yes.
god answered your prayers.
what?
you have to see.
look.
look at him.
and no trace of a fever.
no.
it's a miracle.
no one took it down.
not the old man, not lee.
not even you, sam.
you just got back, kara.
we're trying to get a handle on this.
you gotta cut people some slack.
cut yourself some too.
when i woke up orbiting earth, i just figured it was some crazy dream, but i went in following a heavy raider.
i mean, maybe the cylons pulled me out of the soup, captured me, brainwashed me. on caprica, when they experiment on me, did they take pieces of me? is it possible that they grew me, another me in a petri dish, or they embedded me with the memories or it with the memories, or i don't know.
kara, no.
listen to me.
if you were a cylon, then you've been one from the beginning.
like boomer.
spend my entire life thinking i'm one thing yeah, and then you wake up one day and discover you're another.
it still doesn't change who you really are. it still doesn't change the fact that i love you no matter what.
you are a better person than i am, sam, because if i found out that you were a cylon, i would put a bullet between your eyes.
all hands, prepare for jump in four, three, two, damn it, they're still going in the wrong direction.
one more jump and i'm gonna lose my way altogether.
all right, we gotta find you a rack.
okay, take it easy.
it's roslin.
the old man is not gonna listen to me as long as she's i gotta get to her. you can't do that.
is that a fact?
yeah.
no, no, wait! what the hell are you doing, kara?
where's the president, sam? kara, come on.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
dualla: radiological alarm!
tigh: from where? the olympic carrier, sir.
they've got nukes on board.
if the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
the cylons will be here any second.
if we're gonna do this, then just do it.
it's a civilian ship.
do it.
giving up my seat.
like hell.
helo: sharon?
what are you doing here?
boomer: let's move, mister.
excuse me, lieutenant.
specialist.
good evening.
sir? is something wrong?
no, sir.
it's just morning, sir.
what time is it?
0545.
boomer: oh, my god.
oh, my god.
boomer: where are the rest of them?
gaeta: attention.
colonial one will arrive in 30 minutes.
gaeta: honour detail report in quarters.
tigh: where the hell is it?
damned son of a sash.
i heard you the first time!
tigh: one.
two.
three.
four.
five.
roslin: do it.
apollo: i can't stop thinking about the olympic carrier.
that was three days ago.
it's ancient history under these circumstances.
leave the second-guessing to the historians.
but don't we have a responsibility?
i mean, as leaders, don't we have an obligation to question our actions to i don't know.
to make sure the decisions we make are the right decisions.
we did what we had to do, son. a man takes responsibility for his actions, right or wrong.
he accepts the consequences and lives with them every day.
lso: colonial one, galactica.
proceed to omega docking.
contact cic when you have hard seal.
pilot: roger that, galactica.
billy: excuse me, madam president.
we've arrived please don't tell me that we have to go through this every time i step on that ship.
no, ma'am.
but they will always render honours for your arrival.
it's protocol.
the military, they do love their protocol.
i'm sure if they knew you didn't like it, they'd be willing to roslin: no.
let adama sound the trumpets.
it makes him feel more comfortable.
maybe if he feels more comfortable he'll be a little easier to deal with.
that's smart.
no, it's not smart.
it's politics.
roslin: i think i'm going to get tired of this outfit.
seeing as i only have three for the rest of my life.
that looks fine.
fine? it looks great.
you don't know anything about women, do you?
shall we? let's go be presidential.
i am confident that i speak for the entire fleet when i say thank you. without your extraordinary dedication, your tireless effort, your sacrifice no one of us would be here today.
i'm proud to serve as your president.
thank you.  carry on.
sir, the virgon express is manoeuvring alongside.
they're standing by for unrep.
thank you very much, d. officer of the watch, you'll proceed with the unrep, please.
aye, sir.
adama: if you'll step this way.
roslin: thank you. excuse me, chief.
a word with you, please.
just one second.
you know what?
just let's do it.
what's up? got a problem.
tyrol: yes, sir, lieutenant, sir.
tyrol: i believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection.
dualla: virgon express, galactica.
we have you in visual contact.
maintain current course and speed.
pilot: roger that, galactica.
maintain current course and speed.
powering up stabilisation gyros galactica's water recycling system is close to 100% effective.
for all intents and purposes, there's not a drop of water that's wasted aboard.
adama: we have enough water for several years before replenishing.
i see.
many of the ships like the virgon express were not made for long-term voyages and will have to tank off of us periodically.
right.
whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it, okay?
you all right?
now, tell me what happened.
what's going on?
there are at this moment six g-4 detonators missing from the small-arms locker on deck 15. commander, ready to extend the water boom.
excuse me.
tigh: how's it going?
adama: oh, boy, i feel like a tour guide? it shows?
well, she was a teacher.
probably sees all this as one big educational experience. he thinks i'm a total idiot, doesn't he? what?
no, sir.
no.
it's all right.
what are you telling me for?
if munitions go missing, you got to tell the master-at-arms now! boomer: i know that!
you can't screw around with stuff like this! i'm not screwing around, okay? the only reason i didn't tell anybody is 'cause they're gonna think i'm the one who took them.
how are things?
dualla: things are good.
billy: good.
you look good.
i really like your hair.
my hair?
i don't know anything about women.
madam president, if i may? i think you should know that my father well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
i know.
i think he's enjoying it.
actually, he hates protocol, pomp, and all that.
really?
he's making a gesture.
trying to make you feel like the president.
open valves and 5.  boomer: i took the one detonator from the duffel, replaced it and then i went back to my quarters.
well  you know what?
it's not your fault.
someone's obviously setting you up to take the fall for something.
that's what it is.
you wake up somewhere, you don't know how you got there.
you're drugged, or manipulated, or who knows what.
something.
what do we do? because if i report what's happened, they'll think i'm a cylon agent.
no, they're not.
no.
why would they think that?
that's crazy.
people are getting crazy, okay?
you've heard the rumours.
cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.
decompression alarm!
adama: damage report, mr.
gaeta.
ruptures in tanks 3, 5, 7, 9. tigh: strain on the unrep lines.
they're gonna blow.
release the lines.
veer away, starboard!
every tank on the port side has ruptured.
we're venting all our water directly into space.
cic, it's dc one.
we're entering the tank.
dualla: roger that, dc one.
raptor 478, dc one.
i have you in my sights.
copy that, dc one, i have you in sight.
tyrol: understood.
how's it look in there?
can you tell what happened?
lieutenant, don't worry about my team.
i've got things under control.
copy that, dc one.
i feel better knowing you're on it.
watch the light, you're off target.
how much water did we lose?
ten million jps, sir.
almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
emergency rations.
shut down laundry, showers, anything nonessential immediately.
yes, sir.
how long will our water supplies last?
aboard galactica, about six days.
but one-third of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment.
if we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days.
one-third?
that's 16,000 people.
get the names of those ships.
tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately.
there's gonna be riots in those ships.
civilians don't like hearing they can't take a bath, wash their clothes or drink more than a thimble a day.
thank you for the warning, colonel.
that'll be all, mr.
gaeta.
one more thing.
lieutenant?
do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident?
there are many theories at this point, madam president.
do you have a guess?
i tell my officers not to guess.
i prefer to wait until we have fact.
um-hm.
indulge me.
take a guess, mr.
gaeta.
i'd have to say the most likely explanation is that the tank was structurally weakened during the cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack, and that caused it to buckle and rupture.
gaeta: but it's too early to say.
sir.
roslin: interesting.
thank you, lieutenant.
back to the matter at hand.
i've ordered an astronomical survey of nearby stars systems for potential water sources.
colonel?
yes, sir.
chief, take a look at this. tyrol: what do you got? cally: not sure.
cally: it looks like burn marks from an explosive.
cally: what do you think?
umm  it's tough to tell.
it's pretty rusted out.
optical and x-ray telescopes say there are five systems within our practical jump radius.
all five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water in either a liquid or a frozen state.
put together a plan for raptors to scout each star system.
i want the first launch at 17:30.
yes, sir.
colonel, how likely are we to find water on any of these planets?
now you want me to guess, i take it.
colonel.
sir.
my apologies, madam president.
difficult day for everyone.
i understand.
most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas. the galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate place when you get right down to it.
adama: thank you, colonel.
roslin: the water rationing'll make our supply problem worse.
roslin: dr.
baltar, please share the results of your study.
i've calculated the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs for the civilian population.
baltar: this is based on information available to me at the time.
the current civilian population of 45,265 will require, at minimum and 2.5 million jps of water. is that per month?
per week.
helo: they found your raptor.
a few or a lot? helo: that's what you get for coming back for me.
boomer: frack.
helo: yeah.
i was sure they didn't track me coming in.
i know.
i set the jiggers to pulse.
helo: i'm sure you did.
i didn't set off any detection grids, any dradis sweeps, or ers.
never send a pilot to do an eco's job.
i can do your job.
i guess that's why the toasters are crawling all over our ride out of here.
helo: i don't suppose there's a plan b. plans b, c, and are the same as plan a. get off the planet and get back to the ship.
come on.
where are we going?
boomer: don't ask questions.
just follow your pilot.
yes, sir.
umm so far we've found five discrete detonation points in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth.
i've suspected due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn points that we are dealing with a g-4 type explosive.
so i've requested a spot check of all inventory from the master-at-arms and she indicated to me that there are six detonators missing from a small-arms locker in the port flight pod.
so one detonator may still be unaccounted for.
have the master-at-arms post s at all small-arms lockers immediately.
it's already done, sir.
she also has opened an investigation into who may have had access to that locker.
however, due to spotty record-kee and lax internal security procedures since the attack she believes that we may never know who took the detonators.
adama: chief, thank you very much.
everyone except for col.
tigh, capt.
adama, and dr.
baltar are now released.
adama: please remember: this briefing is strictly confidential.
there is at least one cylon aboard the galactica.
how many people know the cylons look human? the rumour mill's been working overtime.
half the ship's talking about it.
there'll always be rumours.
for most people, that's all they'll ever be.
i'm asking how many people actually know?
tigh: the five people in this room, plus three marines.
roslin: let's keep it that way.
once this gets out officially people will be accusing each other of being cylons for no reason at all.
i agree.
dr.
baltar, how're we doing on the screenings? the screenings?
you were supposed to be screening galactica crew for potential cylon agents.
no.
6: do you remember the first time you lied to a woman?
other than your mother, that is.
baltar: other than my mother.
sherry bennett.
fourth grade.
on the playground, behind the band room.
if you show me yours, i'll show you mine.
she did.
i did not.
you know, i think i slept with her actually, many years later, of course.
no.
6: of course.
no.
6: did she turn out to be a beautiful woman?
as a matter of fact, she did.
very beautiful.
but every woman has her beauty her feminine charms that are hers and hers alone.
adama: doctor?
doctor?
baltar: the screenings.
to tell you the truth, there are significant problems with implementing my cylon detection method that i used aboard galactica previously and basically because i've run out of natural resources.
i need chemical compounds.
for example, the precursor test.
i need large samples of tetrahydrocycline which i don't have to tell you maybe i do have to.
baltar: it's a highly volatile chemical adama: let me stop you there.
your intellect obviously outstrips everyone in this room.
but it's also obvious by the way that you're talking that in order to make large-scale screenings you're going to need help, staff, resources.
yes, that's exactly what i'm saying.
exactly.
although, more staff?
someone snoo around, watching your every move?
maybe it'll be a woman, you could find her secret beauty.
adama: i'm going to assign lt.
gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need.
so much for that.
but the need for secrecy?
clearly, this falls into the absolutely necessary category.
your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival.
humanity's very survival rests in your hands.
now, if only you had an actual cylon detector.
apollo: this is a critical mission.
apollo: fights have already broken out on some ships over the rations.
there's panic in the air.
you don't find water out there and find it soon i understand, captain.
we'll find it.
good hunting.
apollo: hey, chief.
tyrol: captain.
lieutenant.
chief.
i feel like my head's about to explode.
tyrol: just relax, calm down.
focus on the mission.
we'll take care of everything when you get back.
boomer: what about the investigation?
master-at-arms is running it.
don't worry, there's no connection to you. in fact, there's no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all.
boomer: i didn't.
tyrol: i know.
i would never do something like that.
never.
sharon, i know.
it's really important you believe me on this.
you do believe me, right?
absolutely.
tyrol: yes, sir.
boomer: thank you, chief.
carry on.
please excuse me for kee you waiting.
i was called into the engine room.
it'll just take a moment.
roslin: that's all right.
sometime i'd like to borrow a book or two.
i only brought one with me on the flight to galactica.
adama: what book?
roslin: a murder on picon.
roslin: i have a weakness for mystery.
adama: ever read dark day? edward prima.
i am embarrassed to say it's one of those classics i've never gotten around to reading.
i think you'll enjoy it.
thank you.  it may be a while before i get this back to you.
it's a gift.
never lend books.
well, then thank you for the gift.
i'm really looking forward to working with you, doctor.
you have a friend.
as am i, lieutenant.
i actually studied genetics in college.
i was planning on going for my graduate degree through the military extension program.
wonderful.
is that a card game? and the girl wins again.
another round?
come on, guys.
grace under pressure.
nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.
mind if i sit in, lieutenant?
lf you got the cubits, we've got the chair. of course if you've got anything to drink, we'll take that in lieu of cash.
you know i don't have any money, but this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits.
it's made of the finest caprican cloth, warm in winter, cooling in summer.
it'd look great on you.
anybody else got any civilian clothes they'd be interested in putting on the table?
don't let me keep you.
col.
tigh was right.
rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations.
we need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order.
we need to do it now.
we don't have extra manpower for fleet security.
you have the only armed, disciplined force available.
yeah, but i'm not going to be your policeman.
there's a reason why you separate military and the police.
one fights the enemy of the state.
the other serves and protects the people.
when the military becomes both then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
i appreciate the complexity of the issue and i won't let that happen.
i'll send troops to the cruise ship.
commander, i won't let that happen.
beginning dradis one sweep.
beginning dradis two sweep.
so i'm thinking we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name.
i'm thinking kimiko.
kimiko?
after a lovely little lady, in a lovely little city, in a lovely little colony that i used to know.
whatever.
sorry.
so sorry.
you had such a good run, though.
looks like the bet's to me.
baltar: i'll try and muddle through for another round.
i'm going to raise you five.
no guts, no glory, doctor.
i'll see your five and raise you 20. now it's just you and me.
i'm not used to playing in this kind of high-stakes game.
starbuck: it's not too late to bow out.
now there's an excellent suggestion.
and before proceeding any further i should really examine my motivations for doing so.
staying in the game, i run the risk of losing my entire stake and being humiliated in front of these lovely people.
humiliated is a such a strong word.
embarrassed would be my choice.
you do play rough, don't you?
starbuck: a little too rough for you.
my hand's not that strong.
it wouldn't take much to knock me out of the game.
well, thank you, doctor.
however, without a little risk life would be so dull, wouldn't it?
calling.
three on a run.
baltar: full colours.
thank you all for a most pleasant evening.
a parting gift.
baltar: hand-rolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf in caprica.
and it's also one of the last left in the universe.
thank you. my pleasure.
excuse me. the raptors have reported back after three star systems.
so far, all report negative for water, sir.
i just checked with astrometrics.
they're coming up with big goose eggs.
there's no star systems within the range of our telescopes with planetary bodies likely to have water on them.
sir.
another raptor just checked in.
negative on water as well.
adama: who's left?
dualla: boomer and crashdown, sir.
if they come up negative as well what's our back-up plan?
we'll jump to another sector and start the search all over again.
needle in a haystack.
more like grain of salt on a beach.
still nothing and more nothing.
i got nothing here, either.
crashdown: then that's it.
five moons, five zeroes.
i'm getting thirsty just thinking about it.
hope somebody else has more luck out there.
yeah.
crashdown: what's on your mind, boomer?
i don't know.
i have this feeling.
let's run that last sweep again.
you're the boss.
beginning sweep 21. beginning sweep 22. crashdown: boomer, i'm getting nothing again.
how about you?  boomer: i'm having trouble saying it.
crashdown: what do you mean?  i think i see oh! i have positive contact!
yeah!  oh, yes! yeah! good call, boomer.
sir.
dradis just picked up boomer's raptor.
adama: let's hear it.
crashdown: galactica, crashdown.
dradis sweeps indicate it's time to break out the swimsuits because we've found water!
repeat: positive water contact!
patch me in to the entire fleet.
you're connected, sir.
attention.
this is the commander.
we have found water!
let's go have a drink.
i think they're pleased.
i can hear them  in the background.
helo: sharon, be careful with that needle.
we're running low on anti-radiation medicine.
not really mom's home cooking.
yeah? it beats eating grass and leaves.
we'll be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of the week.
you spoil me.
can i ask you something, sharon?
why'd you come back for me? i hate to fly alone.
come on.
you disobeyed orders, flew back into this hellhole and not that i don't appreciate it, but why? i just couldn't leave you behind.
let's leave it at that.
it's a colonial fleet signal.
i can't decode it, but it means there's someone.
someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in caprica.
yes!  now all we have to do is find them.
way to go, boomer!
nice work, sir! nice job.
let's get you debriefed.
yes, sir.
chief.
you think you could take a look at my ejection pyros?
boomer: i think there's a short.
tyrol: yeah.
cally.
no, chief.
you could take a look at it yourself.
roslin: thank you for coming, capt.
apollo.
i am aware that you were in charge of the mission that destroyed the olympic carrier.
roslin: i know what a hard thing that is to live with, for all of us.
roslin: i'm struggling with it myself, frankly.
apollo: i can't stop thinking about it.
but a man has to accept responsibility for his actions.
he doesn't second-guess the choices he makes.
he lives with them.
every day.
you know, i remember when president adar sent the marines into aerilon.
roslin: fifteen people died.
roslin: in public, of course, he had to say all the usual things.
he was sure of what he'd done, he made the right choice he stayed the course.
but he knew it was a mistake.
roslin: and he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer.
he said that it was imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistakes even if they can't admit to them publicly.
you think we made a mistake?
i don't know.
roslin: i don't have a desk drawer yet, but i have a pocket.
roslin: i don't want to add to your burdens, however.
i have a request.
i would like you to be my personal military advisor.
i'm sorry.
my father is the senior military officer.
he should advise you.
no, i don't mean to go behind your father's back.
nothing like that.
i'm not looking for military advice.
i'm looking for advice about the military.
roslin: that little insight about your father making a gesture, that really helped me. it made me reassess the man.
i would appreciate more of those insights.
and you can keep your day job at the c-a-g.
it's pronounced cag.
do you see why i need you? so who's going to tell my father?
well i was thinking that that would be your first assignment.
somehow i knew you were going to say that.
thank you, captain.
hey.
boomer: that is just what i needed.
tyrol: oh, yeah? did you find that detonator?
yes, i did.
i gave it to master-at-arms.
what?
tyrol: no, no.
i told her i found it during maintenance.
listen, calm down.
this is the best way to go about this.
okay? that puts them on the same trail we're on and it doesn't raise any suspicion of you.
listen.
trust me on this, sharon.
i'm not going to let anything happen to you.
okay?
okay.
all right, okay.
tyrol: don't worry, sweetie.
i better go.
all right.
.
male narrator previously on battlestar galactica.
if you go back to caprica and bring me the arrow that will show us the way to earth.
what do you want from me, helo?
she's a cylon.
i'm not gonna let you kill her! okay?
she's carrying my child!
bitch took my ride.
tigh i am placing you under arrest, madam president.
this is mutiny.
you know that.
adama i'm terminating your presidency, as of this moment.
i recommend we execute jump to emergency standby coordinates.
what about our people on the surface of kobol?
if they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
he's not gonna make it.
tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you're gonna have to go back and get it.
you can't send him alone.
you questioning my orders, chief?
i don't want a command.
i never did.
don't you dare die on me now. the cylons are hacking our network.
attempting to access our mainframe.
hotdog what is that thing?
apollo i don't know, but whatever it is, it's bearing on galactica, we've got to take it out!
woman on p,a, attention, damage control to deck 12, hey.
hey.
attention, damage control to deck 12, quite a day, huh? yeah.
wow, i haven't seen you in person since.
two weeks ago.
i've really been thinking about you.
that's nice.
i gotta go.
hey, dee.
dee, hey.
hey.
listen i know that i haven't really made an effort, or it must seem iike i really haven't made an effort to make this, whatever this is, a priority.
but-- but? but you were too busy hel the president spark a mutiny on my ship.
or, but you wanted to wait until you were desperate and needed a shoulder to cry on before making your move?
i think that was a little uncalled for.
yeah, i'm sorry.
you're right.
i gotta go.
what the hell?
lshay grab the emergency flashlights.
kim copy that.
check the ventilator.
kelly we have dma interrupted.
report status.
i'm checking.
gaeta let's check subsystems!
let's get emergency power back on!
hotdog flyboy!
flyboy hotdog!
xo, sitrep?
it's the virus, sir.
i think it must have spawned copies of itself in some of the computer systems.
it's knocked out main power and auxiliary units.
gaeta emergency power just kicked back in.
hey, captain, nice work out there! i'm not sure what you guys are kissing and hugging about.
we screwed up.
we let one through.
kat what's going on with the lights?
apollo i'm not sure.
we still have no idea if we can reach most of the ship.
what the hell was that?
i'm not sure, sir.
checking.
power's out, sir.
i think it's ship-wide.
sound-powered phones is the only thing working.
been trying to get to damage control, but the lines are jammed.
okay.
get the birds tied down and make the ordnance safe.
i'll head up to combat and see what the hell's going on.
yes, sir.
say again, cylons reported in the starboard flight pod.
we've been boarded.
apollo okay, nuggets.
keep moving.
yeah but when i came up on his six, all right, he rotated, so i had to bug out. it was plain, clean, simple.
kat hey, did you see when i turned on that pair chasing me on the port beam?
yeah.
hotdog i saw that.
that was sweet.
i rotate, pull back, hit the brakes, and there, bang! left one's lined up dead-center ring.
i chatter him, turn back to get his wingman.
jesus!
apollo cylons!
come on!
move!
come on!
let's get out of here!
come on!
come on!
go! go! my gods!
it's coming!
kat go! go! go! get the hell out! go! get up!
get out!
go now, now! frak!  you all right, captain?
i'm still breathing.
i guess that's all right.
kat! hotdog, you all right?
hotdog think so.
can i get back to you on that?
sitrep?
we've been boarded, sir.
we don't know how many, where they are, where they're headed.
our standard ammo doesn't even make a dent.
the explosive rounds are the only way to take them down.
how many rounds you got? that was our last one.
all right.
hotdog?
take this to clc.
give it to col.
tigh or the officer in charge.
hotdog yes, sir.
marines, let's go toaster shop.
all clear, sir.
kat, on me.
yes, sir.
gaeta galactica to all ships: we have been boarded by a cylon raiding party, do not approach or attempt to dock with galactica, keep a safe distance until we have secured the ship.
i say again, we have been boarded by a cylon raiding--  what the hell was that? the cylons jammed the signal.
great.
are those ?
yeah.
we can't stay in here.
roslin open the door.
you know i can't do that, madam president.
cpl.
venner, i have no intention of being locked in this cell and shot like a rat in a cage.
open the door!
thank you. hey! hey! hey! apollo cpl.
venner, don't shoot!
it's capt.
adama!
i have a fire team with me! come on in, captain.
watch the companionway.
we're clear, sir.
we've been boarded.
this deck is crawling with cylons.
they're trying to get to the magazines.
how can we help?
stay alive and don't get shot.
leave the cylons to us.
okay, sickbay is the safest spot.
it's farthest away from any potential targets and it's designed to function as a disaster shelter in case the ship were lost.
right.
bonnington, sidearm.
sir.
okay, billy.
you ever handled a weapon before?
a pellet gun from my uncle when i was, like, 10. the principle's the same, the real ones just make a bigger noise.
madam president.
no, thank you. i can't.
corporal.
yes, sir.
you're in charge of getting her down to sickbay.
take bonnington as escort.
remember, just head away from the sound of gunfire.
venner all right.
what about you? well, we're heading towards the gunfire.
okay, listen up.
there's a small arms locker on causeway bravo, two decks down.
we're gonna go get some explosive rounds and then we're heading towards the magazines.
twinam?
twinam sir.
you take point.
yes, sir.
good luck, captain.
may the lords protect you.
and you, too.
twinam clear.
okay, let's go! move.
helo we should probably head out of the city try to scout one of the outlying air bases see if we can find a raptor.
it's not exactly what i expected.
i thought i'd be step over decaying corpses in the streets.
yeah, we saw a few bodies here and there.
not much though.
sharon said.
cylon sharon said they had troops picking up the bodies transporting them to mass incinerators.
your girlfriend's from a lovely family.
good people, great values.
enough, all right?
okay, i was fooled by her.
she fooled me.
you happy now? it's not about making me happy.
then what's it about?
what do you want here?
you want me to say i'm a frakking idiot?
okay.
i'm a frakking idiot.
that make you feel better?
i don't care anymore.
i've been here for months, by myself on the run, one step ahead of the cylons.
with the cylons, i guess, actually.
she seemed so real.
like sharon, you know?
same grin, same laugh, all the little things.
i fell in love with a machine.
it's stupid, so just call me an idiot, and let's be done with it.
you're an idiot.
all right?
you're an idiot.
but the cylons have a way of making all of us look like idiots.
kara, what are you doing?
making a pit stop.
i've got something i gotta pick up.
hey, we gotta keep going.
i got a place here, helo.
the cylon virus spawned itself in our subsystems before we broke the network.
i had teams cleaning each subsystem but it'll be at least an hour before we restore main power.
captain?
what few marines we have are assembling at their checkpoint, but comm. is spotty.
where are the cylons? it looks like they split into two forces.
one moving forward-- forward, one moving aft. yes, sir.
i've seen this before.
these are their objectives.
secondary damage control and auxiliary fire control, sir.
if they're successful, they will override our decompression safeties and vent us all into space.
once we're all dead, they'll turn the ship's guns on the fleet and wipe it out once and for all.
dr.
baltar.
how, in god's name, did you find us?
what do you have there?
it's a child, obviously.
a child?
can i hold it?
please.
is this the shape of things to come?
that's my understanding.
only one thing for it, then.
commander?
please!
commander, where are you going?
come back!
commander!
commander!
commander.
commander, please.
no!  he killed our baby.
our baby?
adama, i saw him drown the baby.
why would anyone want to drown a baby?
gaius, the answer is all around us. what happened here?
human sacrifice.
not the fairytales your scriptures would have you believe.
i thought kobol was supposed to be a paradise, or something.
some place where gods lived with the humans in harmony, or. for a time, perhaps.
then your true nature asserted itself.
your brutality.
your depravity.
your barbarism.
so the scriptures are all a lie.
it's all just a lie, just a cover-up for all this savagery.
exactly.
all of this has happened before, gaius, and all of it will happen again.
adama.
mankind's true nature will always assert itself.
so he will try and kill our baby.
only if you let him, gaius.
only if you let him.
keep your eyes up ahead.
come on.
come on.
go! go! go! go! is it clear?
twinam yeah. is it clear?
all decks, sir.
apollo the keypad's dead.
don't shoot!
don't shoot!
i'm human!
kat jammer?
yes, sir, it's me.
it's me, jammer.
jammer.
don't shoot.
please.
it's jammer.
apollo collishaw!
collishaw sir! watch the hatch!
kat, twinam, find those explosive rounds.
twinam sir.
what the hell happened here?
i don't know, sir.
i wasn't here in this fight.
i just came in here to hide. the cylons are everywhere.
all right, settle down.
you're gonna be just fine.
kat apollo?
you're kidding me.
that's it?
didn't have much to begin with, sir. the other fire teams must've come and cleaned the locker out before us.
six rounds, there are five of us.
okay, well, each of you guys take one.
i'll take the reload.
you're not counting me, are you, sir? i mean, i'm just.
i'm just a knuckle dragger here.
i don't know to fight centurions.
i don't know the first thing about fighting centurions.
come on, let's go.
helo let's do it.
never have your house keys when you need them.
these yours?
you paint these, kara?
yeah.
how the hell did you get power?
batteries.
kept turning off the power.
something about not paying the bill.
that is definitely not you.
it's my dad.
well, we've got one package of noodles.
you don't believe in groceries?
you know, i never really liked this place, anyway.
air conditioning doesn't work in the summer.
heater doesn't work in the winter.
the rent's a crime.
after the attack, i never never pined over any of my old crap.
never missed it.
the stupid view of the parking lot, broken toilet in the bathroom.
you know, everyone i know is fighting to get back what they had.
i'm fighting 'cause i don't know how to do anything else.
roslin how far to sickbay? venner sixty meters.
dualla she stopped breathing a while ago.
billy dee? oh, my gods, it's dee.
hey, are you all right?
yeah.
i was going to the head.
oh, my gods, you're bleeding.
went back to my rack.
are you shot?
i forgot something.
hey.
dee, look at me. dee, look at me. dee? try using her rank.
petty officer dualla, look at me. hey.
hey.
i'm glad to see you.
i've been here in the dark a long time.
it's probably a concussion.
cpl.
venner, we need an alternate route to sickbay.
open your eyes.
look at me. we don't want to walk into gunfire.
we want to go away from the cylons.
now clear your head.
come on.
we can go only.
all the way on the starboard side.
it's a lot farther.
good.
starboard, let's go.
lt.
wallace reports his unit destroyed two centurions at this junction.
they've trapped a third in the ship's laundry.
it can't walk, but it's still shooting.
at least we've contained the threat to auxiliary fire control.
trust me, they're still heading for the aft damage control.
lt.
gaeta?
sgt.
hadrian reports her unit's had to halt their advance on deck 10 at frame 69.
gaeta cylons cut through the hull ahead of her and the compartments are open to space.
smart move.
keeps us from chasing them.
there's nothing between the last two cylons and the decompression safeties.
if you know any prayers, now's the time.
what do you say we take five?
how much further do you think?
tarn getting shot, it wasn't your fault.
you know that, right?
chief?
talk to me, you motherfrakker! motherfrakker.
socinus better appreciate this.
he's probably lying in the sun like some godsdamn emperor.
he's an idiot.
i hope he's okay.
he'll be fine.
he's a tough kid.
we just gotta get him the med kit.
yeah.
get ready to go, cally.
where the hell have you been?
where have you been? i-- doc, where have you been? answer me.
i got lost in the-- answer me! doc, you never run off like that, all right?
you're under my command.
this is military operations, you understand me? what i want to hear from you is, yes, sir! yes, sir.
look, crashdown, l. i'm getting a really bad feeling about this place-- yeah, you and me both, doc.
tyrol flash.
flash!
thunder.
go, go.
here.
where's tarn?
what happened?
the cylons.
were you followed?
no.
how's he doing?
he's not gonna make it.
what?
what do you mean? what are you talking about?
we got the med kit.
give him a shot!
give him another shot!
it's too late.
what do you mean it's too late?
i got you the med kit.
what else do you want?
so we go get the medicine you asked for.
tarn.
for what? for this.
come on, you gotta do something.
you have to do something.
i can't change that he's gonna die, chief.
it's going to be slow and painful, and we can spare him that.
we can spare him that if we give him the morpha from my kit and the one that you brought back.
what?
no.
el-tee?
el-tee, come on.
he's your man, chief.
give it to me.
give it to me.
hey, buddy.
it's chief.
how you doing?
what's going on, chief?
well, you know, listening to the birds.
i got a little something for the pain.
good news, buddy.
we got a rescue party here.
raptor just landed.
we're gonna put you on it and take you back to galactica, okay?
we're going home? yeah.
we're going home.
how're you coming, jammer?
that should do it, captain.
hey, nice job.
you guys, check the deck, check the lockers.
there's gotta be more rounds in here.
yes, sir.
combat, 2-8642, arms locker.
apollo here, colonel, it's apollo.
he's on deck 2, aft frame 86, between the cylons and aft damage control.
apollo, xo, sitrep.
five armed effectives.
we haven't seen anything but bodies between here and the hangar deck.
bonnington clear.
venner okay, from what i can remember the sickbay is about 20 meters through that hatch.
how you feeling?
like i'm walking underwater.
any marines with you? apollo privates collishaw, twinam.
take your men and proceed without delay to aft damage control. is that yours?
yeah, i guess it is now.
okay.
if you're gonna keep it in your trousers like that you might want to turn the safety on.
great.
venner is it stuck?
no, frak! the hatch won't open.
the other side's been depressurized.
all right, cpl.
venner, this is your ship.
i'm just a tourist.
find us another way to sickbay.
okay.
okay, we have to head toward aft damage control.
aft damage control.
apollo aft damage control?
that's what they're after.
tigh let's not waste any more time, you get to aft damage control, and get there right frakking now, mister.
get there before the cylons or we lose the ship. is that clear?
aft damage control.
rfn. on our way.
apollo out.
apollo okay.
hold on.
okay, we made it.
twinam, jammer, you take this side.
yes, sir.
kat, collishaw, you take that side.
we're gonna need some cover.
collishaw all right, let's move.
let's get this stuff out.
yes, sir.
wait.
that's not so-- okay, everybody, get down.
stay down.
hold your fire till i give the signal.
remember, you only have one round, so it's gotta be a headshot to make a kill.
you understand? understood?
yes, sir.
kat, kill the flashlight.
take cover.
take cover.
let's go.
let's go.
let's go.
steady up there, jammer.
yes, sir.
not really cut out for this, sir.
me, neither.
but sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.
what does that mean, sir? i don't know.
it's something my dad says.
just don't shoot till i tell you to, all right?
okay, we're in good shape.
they're coming.
but we're in good shape.
headshot.
reload.
headshot.
headshot.
reload.
headshot.
reload.
headshot.
okay, they're coming.
everybody down!
you want to shoot that, you have to take the safety off.
fire!   venner hey.
are you all right?
yes, i'm fine.
we did it.
we got them all!
they don't look so big now, do they?
apollo they look big enough.
kat oh, gods.
dualla i'll take that.
yeah.
venner have you been shot?
no, i don't think so.
yeah?
yeah, i'm fine.
the gods must be watching over you.
tired of walking?
okay.
thanks.
hey.
how you feel? better.
i thought you said.
forget what i said and listen to what i'm saying.
are you listening?
i'm sorry.
i didn't hear that.
could you.
could you do that one more time?
come here.
let me be clear.
get the curtain.
tigh doc cottle's on his way.
he'll be here any minute.
he's gonna be all right.
you know that.
yeah.
yeah, i know that.
colonel, i assume there's still a cell out there waiting for me? that's right.
cpl.
venner, i'm ready.
i can't believe you sided with that woman against the old man.
i wouldn't do that if you put a gun to my head, and you did.
as far as i'm concerned, you're not fit to wear a uniform.
you're right about that part.
i am not fit to wear the uniform.
and maybe i never was.
then again, neither were you.
but this isn't my ship, and it sure as hell isn't yours.
it's his.
and when he wakes up, he'll decide what to do with the both of us.
thank the gods i didn't have kids.
.
credit. .
i can help you, laura. in ways i cannot help myself.
i can protect you.
but you have to understand the situation has changed now.
the insurgency has crossed the line.
suicide bombings.
it's abhorrent.
it's contrary to everything that we believe in.
so you-- you and i, we will, uh-- we will publicly condemn these tactics.
they cannot be legitimized in any shape or form.
there's something that scares the cylons after all.
i should think using men and women as human bombs should scare us all.
desperate people take desperate measures.
all right, look me in the eye.
look me in the eye and tell me that you approve of sending young men and women into crowded places with explosives strapped to their chests.
i'm waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve.
and their only crime was putting on the police uniform.
trying to bring some order to the chaos out there.
order?
by arresting innocent people in the dead of night.
detaining them indefinitely without charge.
torturing them for information!
nobody's been tortured.
tell that to colonel tigh.
nobody has been tortured.
we're done here.
i hope you understand the severity of the situation.
i'd ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience which is what i've always done. of that i have no doubt.
please give this lovely lady her shoes back.
then get her out of here.
man on pa curfew is now in effect.
severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets.
curfew is now in effect.
severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets.
i don't know about this.
we need to make a point.
the violence must end.
we got a job to do.
what are we doing? is that him?
yeah, just do what he asks.
everything will be okay.
you understand your orders, captain?
everything clear?
yes, sir.
good.
don't worry.
we have your back.
did you hear? the cylons cut food rations toady.
we heard.
how long before the next raptor transmission?
two minutes.
you know, they're taking about shutting down the marketplace.
it's a security risk.
we'll shift targets.
you were gonna hit the marketplace?
the market?
full of civilians.
this is crazy.
you know, we need to figure out whose side we're on.
which side are we on?
we're on the side of the demons, chief.
we're evil men in the gardens of paradise.
sent by the forces of death to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go.
i'm surprised you didn't know that.
contact.
they're ready for the sitrep.
send it twice, just to make sure.
here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention.
i, uh-- i know some of these people.
i'm sure you do.
they're all insurgents, jammer.
we have to break the cycle of violence.
okay, suit up.
you won't have to wear those much longer.
eventually your people will see you as heroes.
not tonight.
take numbers five through ten.
okay, take the tents to the right.
follow down the end.
rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, okay? this is new caprica police.
you're under arrest for colluding with the insurgency.
you're wanting for questioning in the graduation bomb.
cally tyrol, this is an ncp raid.
no! let go of me! get your hands up.
my baby!
no! no, my baby!
no! hey, hey, hey! no, no, no, no.
i got you.
i got you.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
oh, there you go.
mommy's coming back.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay.
their numbers are a little thin. it says here tigh commands that's a lot less than he should have if you count all former fleet officers and enlisted available down there.
could be taking heavy losses.
they mentioned a cylon crackdown.
we should get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group.
somebody's gotta fly those ships off the ground if we're gonna pull this off.
those ships aren't going anywhere yet.
the cylons have removed launch keys from grounded colonial ships.
location unknown.
came from tyrol.
can we manufacture new launch keys?
forget it.
the specs on launch keys are incredibly sophisticated. it would take weeks just to do the r&d.
best option is for saul and the people on the ground to find the original launch keys.
assuming they weren't destroyed.
no.
no way.
the cylons would want to keep them safe just in case they needed to use one of those ships someday.
she's right.
keys gotta still be there somewhere.
we can make a weapons drop to the insurgents.
they know the lay of the land.
they've been hitting the cylons in the teeth for months.
given them the tools, they can kind the keys themselves.
no.
no way.
the only thing you've got going for you so far is that the cylon reduced their defense perimeter to just five baseships.
you put heavy weaponry down there, they're gonna know for sure that we're in contact with the population.
call in ten more baseships and then your whole plan's frakked.
funny.
thought this was our plan, sir.
moving on. the military plans that you have in your hands are to be kept with you at all times.
why'd they pick her up?
she hasn't done anything.
we've got a baby, for gods' sakes.
i don't know.
i'll try to find out.
how long are they gonna hold her? detention is run by a separate ministry.
they don't give us any reasons why they-- godsdamn it, felix.
she hasn't done anything.
we've got a baby.
i know, galen.
i'm sorry.
how do you do it?
how do you help them day after day? how do you look yourself in the mirror?
i gotta get my son.
cameron's watching him, but she's got problems of her own.
chief!
i'll see what i can do.
i'll see if there's something i can find out.
yeah.
why don't you try and do something?
please!
no! no! hey, you okay? jammer, what's going on?
yeah.
yeah, i'm okay, chief.
all right.
hey, uh i heard about last night.
shh.
what? about cally being on one of those lists.
yeah.
i'm really sorry.
yeah.
frakkin' human police, huh? bunch of traitors if you ask me.
some of those guys who joined up, i bet they're in over their heads, you know?
especially now with these suicide bombings and-- at first, i bet you they thought they were doing something good.
you know, get the cylons off the streets.
let us police our own.
they're a bunch of frakkin' idiots.
what did they expect?
you don't know any of those guys, do you?
any names?
names?
no.
n-no idea.
damn.
well, what's up with cally?
why did they put her in detention?
i don't know.
she hasn't done a gods damn thing.
i just talked to gaeta.
says he doesn't know squat.
or so he says.
gaeta's a good guy.
if he knows something-- he's a frakkin' collaborator.
you know what? one day when this is all over, guys like gaeta are gonna get strung up.
and guys like you and me, we're gonna be there tying the knots.
making 'em tight.
it's been a couple of ugly days.
i know you don't care about that, but life means something to us, so i've decided to show you just how precious life can be.
how even in the worst of times it can restore your faith.
remember that breeding farm on caprica?
i remember i blew the frak out of the place.
it wasn't a total loss.
we were able to salvage certain things.
certain medical samples.
like your ovary.
what's that?
this is kacey.
kacey, this is kara.
your mother.
hi.
good girl.
unbelievable.
what?
admiral's decided to put some boots on the ground.
wants to send an officer as a liaison between us and the resistance elements on the planet to coordinate the rescue op.
makes sense.
what's the problem?
it's who he's sending.
he's frakking kidding with this, right?
i wish he were.
mr.
hoshi, i want a raptor prepped and ready in five minutes on the hangar deck.
inform the flagship i'm coming aboard.
i want a private meeting with the admiral.
hoshi aye, sir.
what are you gonna do? what i should've done a long time ago.
you can't do this.
she's a cylon.
well, i trust her.
well, that's a mistake.
well, it'll be my mistake, won't it?
you are gambling with the lives of everyone on this ship.
and everyone on my ship.
i don't need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command.
we're done here.
i'm not finished.
this entire plan is a reckless gamble.
and, yes, you certainly have the right to risk the lives of the men and women under your command.
but that's not the issue.
the issue is that you are risking the lives of the entire human race.
i'm trying to save the human race.
no.
no, you're not.
that's what you're not seeing.
right now, the human race?
well, that's the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships that managed to get away when the cylons came back.
they're the safe bet.
they're the ones whose survival we should .
just like we did after the attack on the colonies.
sharon can penetrate the lon defenses.
it's not about her. the centurio can't distinguish her fromhe other humanoid models.
did you know tha admiral.
they were deliberately programmed that way. the cyns didn't want them becoming self-aware and suddenly resisting orders.
they didn't want their own robotic rebellion on their hands.
you can appreciate the irony.
dad.
i know what you're sayin but we have a reonsibility remember what roslin sd.
our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity.
we can't lose sight of that.
over last year, weelost sight of almost everything.
we gsoft.
if we go back to new caprica now, and we lose, it's over.
humanity just stops.
and an admiral stars don't give you the right to make that gamble.
you're right, son.
you should make plans to resume the search for earth with the pegasus and the civilian fleet.
with pegasus?
what about lactica?
i know why we left those people behind.
and i know it was their choice in the first placeto be and i realize that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else.
but this time i can't live with it.
can't face it.
maybe i'm a coward.
but i'm going back.
dad, you won't have a chance.
i'm going back, son.
leoben once i fertilized your egg, we transferred it to a human woman who carried it to term.
she was pretty, funny.
great smile.
you would've liked her.
although her birth mother died during childbirth, kacey's heart never faltered.
i guess she gets that will to live from you.
i've seen her path.
it's difficult, but rewarding.
she'll know the mind of god in this lifetime.
she'll see patterns that others do not see.
she probably got such spiritual clarity from me.
she'll be hungry soon.
there's food on the table.
you wouldn't let your own child starve, would you?
it's not my child.
i don't even know if it's human.
half-human.
and you know that she's yours.
you just won't admit it.
where the frak you going?
take this with you.
hey! don't leave me alone with this.
frak.
i don't know who or what you are, but i do know this.i'm not your mother.
i don't care that it's effective.
i don't care that the cylons can't stop it.
it's wrong.
no more suicide bombings, colonel.
you understand? what, are you working for the cylons now? i'm sorry.
there's no excuse for that.
you see, little things like that, they don't matter anymore. in fact, not too frakking much really matters anymore.
i've got one job here, lady, and one job only.
to disrupt the cylons.
make them worry about the anthill they've stirred up down here so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.
the bombings, they got the cylons' attention.
they really got their attention, and i am not giving that up.
roslin we are talking about people blowing themselves up.
you know, sometimes i think that you've got ice water in those veins, and other times i think you're just a naive little schoolteacher.
i've sent men on suicide missions in two wars now.
and let me tell you something.
it don't make a godsdamn bit of difference whether they're riding in a viper or walking out onto a parade ground.
in the end, they're just as dead.
so take your piety and your moralizing and your high-minded principles and stick 'em someplace safe until you're off this rock and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair on colonial one again.
i've got a war to fight. the detentions are just causing more resentment.
and more enemies.
we're losing ground with the people.
caprica six i know.
we don't have another option.
we have to send the message that suicide bombings won't be tolerated.
excuse me, sir.
can i talk to you for a moment?
yeah, sure, jammer.
i'll catch up with you.
okay.
sharon, i don't know exactly how to broach this.
nor do i know exactly what i expect you to do about it.
but, um, i thought, you know, since we were-- anyway, since we were back on the galactica-- yeah, jammer, just spit it out.
we picked up chief tyrol's wife in the last raid.
cally.
she's in detention.
i think she's on a list.
frak! mommy.
kacey?
kara?
hi, cally.
it's me, boomer.
i wish i had a gun.
are you all right?
physically, i mean.
what do you want from me? look, a lot's happened.
in everyone's life.
but i want you to know-- i want you and galen to know that i'm happy for you.
especially since you started a family.
something that him and i talked about once before.
can you get me out of here?
i don't know.
i have nothing to do with internal security-- then frak you, sharon, you stupid frakked-up toaster.
how many times do i have to shoot you, anyway?
if you can't help me, then just go away and leave us alone!
all human personnel prepare to present identification before passing through security scanner.
have your ids out.
everyone have their work ids ready.
work ids out.
you! open your bag.
stop her! they had casualties too.
four human dead.
who gives a frak about that?
pardon my language.
you said it, brother.
the power substation was crippled.
almost half the city's without power, and our best estimates put the repairs at two weeks.
do you still think we're being too hard on the human population?
we have a very serious, very straightforward problem.
either we increase control or we lose control.
that's a fact.
we think it's time for stronger measures.
we agree.
we agree.
we agree as well.
how about you? we agree also.
most of us do, anyway.
enough.
what's this? this orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page.
it requires your signature.
my signature?
you're the president.
read it later.
sign now.
just because you've decided to do this doesn't mean you need to drag him into sin with you.
don't you lecture me about sin.
i'm not the one who committed the first act of cylon on cylon violence in our history.
what's she talking about?
she crushed my head in with a rock back on caprica.
interesting she didn't tell you.
it's something i had to do.
i'm not proud of it.
this is all very interesting.
very edifying.
sign the order.
you don't need my signature.
well, actually, we do.
we're here as allies and friends of the legitimate government of the colonies.
you are the president, so everything we do requires your signature.
in other words, they're worried about what god might think if they commit murder.
they're covering their existential asses.
i won't do it.
all right, i won't do it.
you're going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
then we'll find another president.
stop this.
this is crazy!
dear god.
she'll be back.
but if he pulls that trigger now, you won't.
sign it.
sign it!
sign your name!
sign it!
sign it!
there's nothing you can do, gaius.
it'll be okay.
it's you.
help me.
you have to sign it.
they'll kill you if you don't.
sign it!
sign it!
sign it!
sign your name!
sign it!
i can't.
i won't.
you can't force-- sometimes you have to do things you hate so you can survive to fight another day.
raise your right hand and repeat after me.
i, sharon agathon i, sharon agathon do now pledge my faith and my loyalty do now pledge my faith and my loyalty to the protection of the 12 colonies of kobol.
to the protection of the 12 colonies of kobol.
and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors as an officer as an officer in the colonial fleet. in the colonial fleet.
congratulations, lieutenant.
never thought i'd live to see the day.
me neither.
looks good on you.
belongs on you.
you know what this means to me.
one of the first things they taught us at the academy was that symbols matter.
uniforms, flags, banners, even mascots.
they're like pieces of your heart you can look at.
this uniform it means a lot to me, sharon.
i know it does, helo. it means a lot to me, too.
i won't betray it.
thanks.
can i ask you a question?
how do you know?
i mean, how do you really know that you can trust me?
i don't.
that's what trust is.
good hunting, lieutenant.
that was really something.
thought you might like that.
you didn't do the twist this time.
what do you call--what's that deal you did right at the end?
what do you call that?
you mean the swirl.
oh, the swirl.
boy, that's really something.
well, you said you wanted something memorable.
how is saul?
fine.
when's his next meeting with the insurgents?
no point in denying it, ellen.
we know he's their leader.
why do you think we let him out of detention?
i thought it was because of the twist.
well, yes, that too, for sure.
but having the colonel out and active with the resistance presents us with certain advantages.
i don't know anything about-- let's just consider your denials as read, shall we? i want a specific place, and i want a specific time for a very high level meeting of the insurgency leadership.
and if i don't get it, we pick up saul again.
tomorrow, the galactica is going to send two raptors, several marines, and a ground liaison officer is gonna brief us on the rescue mission and help coordinate our evac plans.
i'll be damned.
it's really happening.
who's the liaison officer?
sharon.
i hope that's your idea of a joke.
admiral adama has given her a uniform and a billet.
she is a serving officer.
which is more than you can say about us, technically speaking.
the old man's lost his mind, all right.
where's the rendezvous?
they left that up to us.
okay, here's my suggestion.
if they jump into breeder's canyon out here in the southern range-- come.
hi, guys.
hey.
ellen.
anyway, like i was saying, if they jump in here they won't get picked up on cylon dradis.
that's a long way out there. a lot of ground to cover by foot.
i realize that.
i'm gonna meet them halfway.
right about here.
now, there's good cover from the air.
it's pretty isolated.
gotta be sure.
may be the most important meeting we're ever gonna have.
colonel, i'm sure.
this is the place.
the cylons will not find them here.
all right, give me the map.
you got the message memorized?
all the wireless freqs?
yes, sir.
well, then give me the message, too.
i'll do that, saul.
don't get up.
thanks.
colonel, i've assembled a team of about six to eight men and women about half a dozen times.
we have provisions for a couple of days if we need 'em.
we have access to running water.
i know that place like the back of my hand.
this is gonna work.
gaius!
gaius! did you sign this? tell me you didn't sign this, gaius.
not now, mr.
gaeta.
i'm very tired.
this is a death warrant.
have you seen the names on this list?
do you have any idea what they're about to do out there? are you listening to me? i didn't have any choice.
what the hell's the matter with you? there are over 200 names on this list.
have you even looked at the names?
look at the names, gaius!
i've seen them!
i've seen them, all right?
and there was nothing i could do.
back to your frakking tents.
everybody back to your tents.
and you do triple digits.
you can do that.
let me see-- laura roslin.
come with us, please.
killing tyrol's wife will only embitter him against us.
he's the head of a labor union.
come on, sharon, let's just be honest with one another.
in your view, you don't think there's any reason to kill any of them, correct?
right.
well, we made a decision.
all of us.
just like when we listened to you and caprica six when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter in cylon-human relations.
this has nothing to do with whether or not we execute cally.
no one enjoys the thought of mortal death, boomer.
but she tried to murder you.
maybe it's god's justice.
need a lift, mr.
vice president?
guess so.
haven't seen much of you lately.
been busy these days?
well, not much to do in detention.
how long have you been held?
four months, i think.
i told baltar i wouldn't have any part of collaborating with the cylons.
and he got a little pissed.
i think he's a little pissed at me, too.
jump complete.
right on target.
okay, hang on, guys.
i'm drop down to the landing point and there's some heavy turbulence up ahead.
follow the river.
make sure you hug the bank.
stay back and provide cover.
go, panthers!
c-bucks rule!
hey, sam.
been a long time.
funny.
i feel like i see you every day.
come on.
let's go.
lords please don't take her life.
it was my mistake.
don't punish her for it.
it was an accident, kara.
nothing more.
kacey?
kacey, oh, my gods.
honey.
let them stretch their legs for a minute.
yes, sir.
let's go.
all right, everybody out.
five minute rest break.
come on, move!
everybody out! give minute rest break.
come on, let's go! come on, five minutes.
everyone out.
let's go.
let's move.
come on.
move, people!
tell me something, laura.
hmm? last year?
mmm? you tried to steal the election, didn't you?
yes, i did, tom.
i wish you'd gone through with it.
me too.
we'll wait until nightfall before we go back to the city.
there's a system of tunnels we've been using-- shh! did you hear that?
take cover!
take cover!
go! you.
over here.
run.
run.
don't look back.
go!
previously on battlestar galactica aurora, goddess of the dawn.
i thought it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
a fresh start.
thank you. starbuck, you're getting too low!
come on, lee, get her out of there.
you come back!
just let me go.
no! baltar's trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling i've been having for a while.
it's time for a change.
please, god, don't let this child die.
how can you take him and let me live?
god answered your prayers.
you have to see.
look at him.
and no trace of a fever.
no.
it's a miracle.
i need to know about the other five.
the types we've never seen.
it's true.
we're cylons.
and we have been from the start.
even after that raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
you think it recognized you as a cylon?
maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
more important, why didn't i shoot him?
okay, what the hell's going on?
i'm off the ship for a few hours a few hours?
kara, you were gone for over two months.
that's impossible.
how did you get here?
i told you, i don't know exactly.
damn it, they're still going in the wrong direction.
one more jump and i'm gonna lose my way altogether.
it's roslin.
the old man's not gonna listen to me.
i gotta get to her. no, wait! look alive!
and for frak sake, don't shoot the godsdamned president! just let me talk to her. talk all you want, but it ends with the first bang.
we're rollin' down here.
starbuck's got the president.
gaeta, take the com.
move.
move!
come on.
move, come on!
over by the couch.
now! i want to hate you so much.
so much.
you had a vision, remember?
the arrow, the temple.
i went down to that planet with you, and it was a frakkin' toaster party.
a lot of good people died, remember?
yes, i do.
i trusted you.
on a vision.
that's it a vision!
i saw earth.
i saw it with my own eyes.
and it's calling me back.
we're going the wrong way.
why can't you trust me?
shoot me.
if you think i'm a cylon, them i'm your enemy.
shoot your enemy.
take it!
i'm no more a cylon than you are.
and you know it.
i wish i did.
i've put my life on the line for this frakkin' ship.
i have ate, slept, and fought next to the people that i love.
i have pissed off my friends!
i have broken more rules than i've followed!
i frakked up, okay! i messed up! but it's all that i have.
those people are my family.
and none of us belong here.
two down.
we've got two down!
shoot me! if i'm a cylon, shoot me! they made you perfect, didn't they? down on the floor now! now! let go of me! get off me! get off me! what are you doing?
i am not a cylon, mathias!
madam president.
gods! what the frak's going on here?
i thought you were on the move.
she's out of her frakkin' mind.
gods! you all right?
get off me! get off!
listen to me, please.
i'm losing it.
the ringing the way to earth it's getting weaker.
don't you understand? don't any of you understand?! it was so it was so clear.
like it was coming from the next room.
stop looking at me like that.
i can feel it slip away.
even without jum, as we move, it's half of what it was when i got here.
half.
if we keep jum, it'll be gone, and we'll never find it again.
i thought that's what we wanted.
a way to earth.
do you hear me? get her out of here.
yes, sir.
let's go! you better work on your aim, because i'm not gonna stop!
you're gonna have to kill me! one more jump and it'll be gone!
admiral!
battlestar galactica season - episode transcript = swsub.com
- thanks, insults, appreciations = lords of kobol - the excited state decays by vibrational relaxation into the first excited singlet state.
yes, yes, and merrily we go.
reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03%.
it is not much consolation that society will pick up the bits, leaving us at eight modern where punishment, rather than interdiction, is paramount.
please, cut the fuse.
they will not harm their own.
end of line.
limiting diffusions to two dimensions increases the number of evolutionary jumps within the species.
rise and measure the temple of the five.
transformation is the goal.
they will not harm their own.
the hybrid is clearly telling us something.
the hybrid is always telling us something.
they're supposed to maintain operations on each ship, not vomit metaphysics.
all right, i give up.
what what is she trying to tell us? they're in the colonial fleet with the humans.
they?
they who? the final five. the raiders refuse to fight because they sense the final five might be in the colonial fleet.
they could have been caught or hiding.
no way, stop.
stop, right now.
turn around, go and take a cleansing walk, and i am gonna try and forget what i just heard.
the final five cavil, they're near.
this is far too important.
what their eyes must have seen, witnessed over time think they look anything like us? that's enough! don't you realize what you're doing?
you're openly discussing the final five! that's forbidden!
you're toying with our survival.
look at yourselves.
look, there's millions of twos have that nose.
millions of sixes possess that mouth.
eights share those breasts, and ones have this brain.
we're mechanized copies.
there's a reason the original programmers clearly felt that it's a mistake for us to contact the final five! no! violating that programming threatens our survival!
something has changed.
thoughts have changed.
yes, they change.
the raiders changed.
that's where all this started, with them.
somehow they exceeded their programming, and unlike us, they can't correct themselves.
so we're gonna have to do it for them.
do what?
we'll reconfigure their neural architecture, and shave down their heuristic responses.
dumb them down?
lobotomize them?
they're tools, not pets.
but in any case, it has to be done.
says who? says god almighty, the voice of reason, that's who! when are you gonna hear it?
you don't have the authority to make any change without a majority vote.
well, we'll vote.
the fours and fives will be on my side.
there will be a vote.
the raiders hear what we hear.
the raiders are simple machines.
no.
something extraordinary has happened.
something is calling to us.
pushing us to discover our origins, to understand our place in the universe.
the raiders are part of that, and the final five are anywhere but with the humans.
you're late.
i had to wait for cally to nod off, okay?
she's having trouble slee.
did you see kara? i saw her.
she's crazy as a latrine rat.
if anything, she's more like starbuck than ever.
she's my wife! and the president nearly put a bullet in her skull because she suspected her of being a cylon.
you are one!
we bring attention to ourselves, we're frakked! if starbuck is one of us, she's playing it big the other way.
the four of us heard the music and sought each other out.
she hasn't.
we're still missing one.
baltar.
not baltar, but when i found him in the temple on the algae planet, he was with one of those skin jobs.
the one they call d'anna.
she saw something in there i don't know what.
but they talked.
he might know something.
he's got those one-god nutcases believing he's some kind of healer.
he brought some boy out from a coma.
maybe he knows who the fifth is.
maybe he knows who we are.
then we gotta get in close and find out.
how do you propose we do that?
take him out for drinks?
well, he is accomplished at two things.
lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.
he'd poke a skin job. he racked up a six that's a given.
there is no way.
you don't have to get on your back for him, but oh, gee, thanks.
what were you doing?
what were you thinking?
what happened to you? i saw earth.
the shape of it, the smell of it.
the feel of it on my skin in my pores.
and i swear to you, it was like i'd been there before.
like i never left.
you're too stupid to figure out you just screwed over the one ally you had.
you didn't have the guts to hold on.
tell me who's gonna help you?
yeah, frak me, huh? it sure as hell isn't gonna be you.
you've gotta remind yourself that you're somebody else.
you're the president's wet nurse.
you're the one who doesn't have the guts.
nice to know you still care, admiral.
we're going the wrong way! we have all conferred with our models, and the results are in.
the fours and the fives have joined us ones, and they voted to reconfigure the raiders.
gee, what a surprise.
well, the twos, sixes and eights voted against it, so we're deadlocked.
how hopelessly but you were right.
and i'm machine enough to admit that i was wrong.
what are you talking about?
something extraordinary has happened.
eight.
what's going on?
boomer.
i'm not going to sugarcoat this.
i'll just say that this eight has voted to reconfigure.
what?
shocked?
i was shocked too.
but no one has ever voted against their model.
no one.
is this true?
we have to be able to defend ourselves.
no, this is unconscionable.
this is wrong.
she can't.
you had something to do with this.
no, it was her decision totally.
you cannot allow this.
there is no law.
there's no edict.
there's nothing that forbids it.
it's just it's never happened before.
try and remember you said that when he boxes your line.
now, don't be a sore loser.
if you do this, we all lose.
we think it's for the best.
the best?
have you lost your mind?
our identies are determined by our models.
each model is unique.
we belong together.
you know this better than anyone.
mechanized copies.
those are your very words.
something has changed.
those are your very words.
and i whole heartedly agree.
the raiders are sentient, just as we are.
there was a plan.
a divine plan in our design.
you're butchering them.
we're reconfiguring them.
you are not god.
no i'm a mechanic.
the raiders were designed to do a specific job.
they stopped doing it.
i'm fixing that.
and when the cutting's all done, they'll go back to being happy warriors.
so let's move on, all right?
i'll pray for you.
i'll pray hard.
all right, you hooch hounds!
lock it up!
it's time shut the frak up! pay attention.
we're saying good-bye to the best damn jock you pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.
shut up.
major?
let's go! come on!
i have a drink.
let's do this.
come on now.
i'm not thirsty.
to galactica! to the men and women of galactica.
to the admiral who commands the men and women of galactica.
and to our sweethearts, husbands, and wives.
to our sweethearts!
to absent friends.
thank you. that's very sweet.
excuse me, will you?
watch your step.
you say what?
excuse me.
you're spying on me, tory.
i've seen you here.
no. i heard about the miracle.
the child?
yes.
you mean laura roslin has heard about it.
all right, i have been spying on you.
well, it's lucky i was sitting down, isn't it?
i've been watching these people.
the way they look at you. if you go squealing to the president that my newfound popularity borders on the phenomenal, then she should be very worried.
i came here on my own.
and i slept with your boss last night.
come on, be nice.
what's it gonna cost you?
my god.
my giddy-od!
get a grip, gaius.
she's not lying.
she really could be a wonderful source of information.
why don't you feel her out?
feel her what?
what?
i'm not talking to you.
actually try and forget me for a moment.
ask her what she's doing here.
i am talking to you.
why did you come here?
maybe it was a mistake.
well, i can't stop thinking about what's happened.
you were found innocent when everyone hated you.
i hated you.
and this healed boy, the return of kara thrace i mean, everyone thought she was dead.
so perhaps there are miracles.
perhaps.
thing is, somehow you seem to be at the center of them.
yes, i do, don't i? i don't understand myself, to be honest.
just well, it seems that god has chosen me to sing his song.
a song?
music.
did you say music?
yeah, you know, it's funny.
it's a lot like that.
it's it's like the distant chaos of an orchestra tuning up.
and then somebody waves a magic wand, and all of those notes start to slide into place.
a grotesque, screeching cacophony becomes a single melody.
i really shouldn't be seen here.
who the frak are you?! what, am i supposed to be impressed?
i mean, you're me.
obviously you're me, so unless you're not me.
huh? six? is it you, six like in disguise?
now, why would she need to disguise herself from you? well, you've got a very good point.
let's talk about tory.
where is she? we should talk about tory, 'cause we both know where this is heading.
you like her, don't you?
yeah, well, you know, she's she's a sexy lady.
yeah, yeah.
hot.
you slay me.
you really do, gaius.
why? she's more than all these things.
she's special.
and you feel it.
yeah, fragile.
yeah, i sense that too.
you're very observant.
fragile.
handle with care.
oh, i'd love to.
you're enjoying that more than usual.
hair of the dog.
lee's party.
what do we do now?
put her on trial?
find romo lampkin?
take a show of hands?
i don't know.
follow her into an ambush?
she is driven.
yeah.
you gonna keep waltzing, or are you gonna sit down and talk?
what's going on?
sit.
what if she's telling the truth?
she was supposed to die out there.
she didn't.
i can't explain it.
what if she was meant to help us?
and this was a a what? a miracle? is that what you want to call this? go ahead, say it.
grab your piece of the golden arrow.
i want to hear admiral atheist say that a miracle happened.
you shot at her and you missed at close range.
doloxan fraks with your aim.
so does doubt.
i pulled the trigger and i'd do it again.
she put her life in front of a bullet as if it had no meaning.
you drop an egg, you reach for another.
maybe convincing you meant more to her than her own life.
is that your miracle?
you want to talk about miracles?
the very same day that a very pale doctor informed me that i had terminal cancer, most of humanity was annihilated, and i survived.
and by some mathematical absurdity, i became president.
and then my cancer disappeared long enough for us to find a way to earth.
you can call it whatever you want.
and now i'm dying.
don't talk that way.
you've gotta face this.
my life is coming to an end soon enough, and i am not going to apologize to you for not trusting her. and i am not i am not going to trust her with the fate of this fleet.
you are so buckled up inside you can't take any more loss.
your son's leaving this, me i know it.
no one's going anywhere.
okay here's the truth.
this is what's going on.
you want to believe kara.
you would rather be wrong about her and face your own demise than risk losing her again.
you can stay in the room, but get out of my head.
you're so afraid to live alone.
and you're afraid to die that way.
you're afraid that you may not be the dying leader you thought you were.
or that your death may be as meaningless as everyone else's.
zarek nominated me for the vacant quorum spot, so i you're zarek's wing man.
all right, all right, you know, stow it, okay.
i've heard it all before.
the guy's a piece of work, i know.
his head's as big as the house i grew up in but i'm i'm pretty new to all this.
i could use the help.
besides, i never really could say no to anything.
except me.
especially you.
you know, i think i finally understand what you meant about having a destiny.
i've got to do this.
and the fact that i don't have an explanation why doesn't doesn't really seem to matter anymore.
so say we all.
so say we all.
good luck on your journey, lee adama.
you too, kara thrace.
all right.
lee i believe you.
red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow.
starbuck, if you've got a problem, i don't want to hear it.
my only problem is you didn't preach that sermon a week ago.
keep your ears open.
any cylon contact, just shut down, bug out.
questions.
when will you play to the card game? we're on tomorrow night!
all right, all right.
good luck.
and be careful out there.
attention to orders! in recognition of honorable, loyal, and faithful service, madam president, admiral of the colonial fleet, ladies and gentlemen major lee adama salute!
good luck.
thank you. well, it looks like you got the house.
i'll miss you.
good-bye, lee.
look after yourself.
we want you to stop lobotomizing the raiders, cavil.
raiders with free will?
not going to happen.
do you know what just really rankles my ass?! you've been pointing fingers, falsely accusing me of manipulation just short of tyranny.
when you're the one that's been leading the charge here.
we want you to stop.
you're not in charge.
we had a vote.
for the last time, will you stop lobotomizing the raiders?
it's unbelievable, isn't it?
unbelievable.
for the last time, no.
i was afraid you'd say that.
come in.
what is this about?
centurions can't vote, six.
they're not here to vote, cavil.
am i hurting you? no.
what's wrong?
nothing.
what do you mean, nothing?
you're .
it's just something i do during sex.
all the time?
yeah.
i'm really sorry.
don't be sorry.
why should you apologize?
you should be thankful.
you have an abundance of feeling.
i've never really thought of it like that.
you're blessed, aren't you?
i don't know.
i guess.
i suppose i couldn't be a cylon.
well, i don't know about that.
human beings don't exclusively hold the patent on suffering.
cylons can feel.
you believe that?
yeah, i do, actually.
i've spent time amongst them.
man may have made them, but god's at the beginning of the string, isn't he? it's god who made the real soul.
the one true god.
one god? the one true god.
you know, i'm becoming increasingly tired of holding that in. of denying that essential truth.
now, this this isn't funny.
leave.
i said leave! why don't they leave?
the telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the centurions we had them removed.
say what?! you dumbed down the raiders.
we the leobens, the sharons, gave the centurions the gift of reason.
you have no authority to do this, none.
you can't do anything without a vote!
no, we can't do anything with one, so we're finished voting.
what have you done?
first thing they learned is what you were doing to the raiders.
you can imagine how they felt.
oh, no.
sir, the fleet is prepped and ready for jump.
execute jump.
go back!
go back open cell.
cuff her.
so you quietly cut me loose in deep space.
i'm not afraid to die.
little easier after you've been through it once.
harder.
especially now that i'm seeing things so clearly.
you're making a mistake.
maybe i am. but i can't take the chance that you're right and not do something about it.
helo hand-picked a crew for you.
i'm giving you a ship.
i hope you can stand the smell.
we liberated the demetrius.
it's a sewage recycling ship.
the party line will be that we're going for a scouting mission.
looking for food.
so you think i'm right.
maybe, maybe not.
but i know she is, the president.
she's been right all along.
i'm tired of losing.
i'm tired of turning away from the things that i want to believe in.
and i believe you when you say that you'll die before you stop trying.
and i won't lose you again.
now go.
find a way to earth.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
billy: the captain of the astral queen wants you to know he's got 1,500 prisoners under heavy .
tell him i want daily reports on the well-being of his prisoners.
the president has given me a direct order.
adama: we're in the middle of a war and you're taking orders from a schoolteacher?
helo: don't suppose there's a plan b? boomer: plans b, c, d, are the same as a. get off the planet and get back to the ship.
roslin: how much water did we lose?
almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
if we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days.
gaeta:  reveille, morning stations aboard battlestar galactica.
all hands report to your stations.
tigh: so, what do we have?
tyrol: good news, colonel.
we scouted the ice moon.
found an entire subsurface ocean.
we've got reports and video for you.
tigh: not exactly caprica beach down there, chief?
no, sir.
we've registered temperatures venting of methane and c02.
it's gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.
cheer up.
you know how lucky we are we found this ugly rock?
water riots breaking out all over the fleet.
civilians.
tigh: whiney civie cry-babies can't stand less than a hot shower every day.
tyrol: yes, sir.
even galactica's down to 10,000 jps of water.
tigh: ever see a man die of dehydration?
tyrol: no, sir.
let's hope you never do. it isn't pretty.
so, where were we? we drilled 23 core samples.
we can't drink salt water!
no, sir.
that's why i had cally test the ice.
well, there you go.
pure water.
couple of lemons, we could make lemonade.
tyrol: yes, sir.
we'll have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship.
what's that gonna take?
high-capacity heater expansion tanks, d-25 plasma torches myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps.
sounds like a lot of manpower.
ideally 1,000 men, sir.
one thousand men? and where're they gonna come from?
slave labour.
they are criminals.
they've been sentenced to hard labour.
and this is very hard labour.
not to mention physically dangerous.
this is not for civilians, but apollo: their ship wasn't designed for long-term incarceration.
apollo: these men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks now.
they might even prefer to get out.
do something, even if it is dangerous.
if they volunteer.
but these aren't slaves and i will not have them treated as such.
no.
we could offer incentives.
apollo: points towards earning freedom.
adama: excuse me.
you wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet?
sir, these men were on their way to caprica for parole hearings which at least implies they may be ready for release.
make it happen, captain.
yes, sir. to address commander adama's concerns, i'd like you to go along and set up a screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals.
i would like to have a representative from galactica who will report directly to me about security issues.
how about d? billy: second class petty officer dualla.
adama: i know who she is.
i'm not sure she's conversant with the technical details.
she'll be fine, but we should send someone from ground crew who'll make sure the chosen men know to use the equipment.
agreed.
i have to get to the cic.
excuse me.
billy: madam president? the doctor.
roslin: excuse me? billy: the doctor?
commander, do you have a ship's doctor aboard galactica?
maj.
cottle.
is there something wrong?
no, nothing urgent.
allergies.
he's out on the fleet checking medical conditions.
adama: i'll tell him that you want to see him.
roslin: thanks.
petty officer dualla.
conversant in technical details.
thinking entirely of the mission.
something on your mind, captain?
i just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say.
i have nothing to say to the personal representative of the president.
i'm still galactica's lead pilot.
i have nothing to say to him, either.
every man has to decide for themselves which side they're on.
i didn't know we were picking sides.
that's why you haven't picked one yet.
wilkens: i'm a bus driver, not a warden.
apollo: how many total?
wilkens: 1,500.
wilkens: they don't give me their files or their names.
wilkens: hell, they're just numbers.
apollo: thanks, wilkens.
all right.
they're all yours.
i'm capt.
lee adama, personal representative of the president.
we're in a crisis.
thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration.
the good news is we have found water.
the bad news is, it's located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions.
we need 1,000 able-bodied men to help us get that water.
president roslin feels that you represent our best chance.
she also recognises that you are not slaves.
any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn freedom points which can be applied toward earning his release.
we're offering you a chance for a new beginning.
whoever is interested, please just step out of your cell.
zarek: thank you for your offer.
we respectfully decline.
prisoner: zarek!
oh, my god, that's tom zarek.
the terrorist?
prisoners:  zarek!
wilkens: so who the hell is tom zarek?
billy: he's a freedom fighter.
he's a prisoner of conscience.
he's a butcher.
his colony was exploited by the other 11 for centuries.
his people were marginalised, brutalised i'm from saggitaron, and that man doesn't speak for all of us. he blew up a government building, there's no excuse for that.
captain, i've been watching the clock and if we won't get any help, we should move on.
zarek's got the prisoners united.
let's go through zarek.
helo: hello?
anybody out there? anybody wanna help two stranded pilots? helo: that's what i hate about big cities.
no one will help you.
boomer: no more shouting.
you're making me nervous.
feel like i'm in a movie.
at least it stopped raining.
for now.
where is everyone?
some are dead.
in their beds, at their desks.
ones who weren't killed outright probably ran into the hills.
won't do any good.
guess i'm getting a little depressing?
morbid?
sorry.
been here longer than you.
wish i could say it gets easier.
boomer: there's more.
helo: boomer, you might not wanna frakking rats.
let's go.
come on.
let's find a hospital, score some anti-radiation meds, okay?
we've only got two days' worth left.
sharon, we've made it this far.
we're gonna make it all the way.
right.
damn straight, all the way.
we're doing good, real good.
i guess someone must be watching out for us.
doral: she's good.
so far.
jealous?
no.
6: this all makes me makes so sad.
doral: they would've destroyed themselves anyway.
they deserve what they got.
we're the children of humanity.
that makes them our parents, in a sense.
true.
but parents have to die.
it's the only way children come into their own.
no, that's not necessary.
i'd like to talk to you.
.
prisoner 893893 requests permission to speak with his visitor.
seaborne: granted.
we're not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question.
and you didn't ask me a direct question.
zarek: you've never been in a prison before, have you, captain?
apollo: no.
zarek: you're fortunate.
may i sit down?
yes, of course.
apollo: we need these men of yours to help us.
they're not my men.
they belong to you.
i belong to you.
you own us.
you're the master, we're the slaves.
apollo: you're clearly a man of principle.
apollo: i respect that.
zarek: really? the things you've stood for over the years, the book you wrote.
the book that had to be smuggled out of labour camp because stumps aren't allowed freedom of expression?
i read it.
in college.
thought it was radical, challenging.
made me question some things i'd accepted before without thinking.
nice to hear i'm a big hit on campus.
you weren't, the book was banned.
i read it anyway.
point is, i understand where you're coming from.
but i don't think you understand how critical the situation is out there.
people are gonna start dying.
hey, starke.
it's time for your break.
billy: how can you say that?
dualla: it's the truth.
zarek and the sfm, they don't care about justice.
billy: his people, your people have been exploited.
you can't tell me about my people.
i'm not telling you about your people.
all i want, the president wants is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom.
now you've said the truth: freedom is earned.
stay where you are, captain.
it'll all be over soon.
seaborne: nobody try anything!
back up!   seaborne: we've got the s and the crew in separate cells in block 7. mason is looking after the hostages.
zarek: nice job.
seaborne: everything's under control.
the men are organising exactly as planned.
i knew i could count on you.
stay frosty there, billy.
everything's gonna be all right.
i don't know about that.
they don't wanna hurt us.
that won't get them what they want.
which is what?
lt.
thrace.
good to see you.
good to see you, too.
baltar: really?
starbuck: no.
oh.
i wonder if she's a real blonde.
i doubt it.
now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately.
a little too hot.
a little i don't know.
he's burning up the deck with his skids because he can't pull back on the throttle.
who is the speed demon, my prince?
flat-top, sir.
starbuck: flat-top.
you got a need for speed, do you?
can't wait to get back to the big and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots? or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand. it never gets a headache.
tell you what, flat-top, you come in too hot today you may have to start using your left.
all right.
you've been fun, you've been a great audience.
dismissed.
tigh: there's no smoking in the ready room.
starbuck: my room, my rules, sir.
where's your mummy?
dead.
where's yours?
i'm looking for boomer.
1400.
boomer's in the tool room.
a pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it?
at people doesn't always get the best results, sir.
i learned that at officer candidate school.
you are right on the edge, thrace.
careful you don't fall off.
speaking of falling off  glad to see you've found a way to quench your thirst.
they won't negotiate while you're holding hostages.
i don't wanna negotiate.
then what do you want? to be treated like men, not animals.
finally have something to bargain with.
so what happens now? we're gonna talk.
what about?
your father. is this a monclair original?
yes.
baltar: fantastic.
adama: would you like some water?
yes, thank you. i'm not a collector myself, but i i am familiar with his work, and may i say you really do have an excellent eye for art.
thank you.  where's my cylon detector, doctor?
oh, that.
yes, it's taking longer than expected, unfortunately.
what's the hang-up?
it's not working this time, gaius. he can see right through you.
there are a number of obstacles none of them insurmountable, but they do tend to slow us down.
for a start, the lack of proper facilities.
the water shortage, of course.
the water shortage, not to mention adama: cut the bs.
you said you had a way of detecting human from cylon.
do you or don't you?
i don't.
what?
i don't think that i'm the man for this job.
baltar: i'm not cut out for this kind of work.
you have to do this.
why do i keep putting it off?
it's my subconscious telling me that i'm not the man for this job, please.
listen to me.
if you don't tell him what he wants to hear he's going to find you out.
and when he does, they're going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an air lock!
pardon me.
i haven't had much sleep recently, so  unfortunately, doctor, for both of us you're the last man we have.
so what's the game plan, doc?  this is what you say: commander, the truth is, there is one way.
say it!
commander, the truth is there is one way.
repeating after no.
6 i didn't wanna have to ask you for this but what i really need to complete the project is a nuclear warhead.
that how you got to be the personal representative of the president?
zarek: because of your father?
apollo: hardly.
so, they don't get along, adama and roslin?
they have their differences.
but not when it comes to dealing with terrorists.
i thought you said you respected me.
read my book.
that was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking.
always better when the oppressed don't fight back, isn't it?
a warhead?
no.
6: technically, i need the plutonium inside.
technically, i need the plutonium inside.
figure out the rest for yourself.
as you may know, the cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation and by taking the plutonium and embedding it in a carbon nanotube matrix and it really is that simple i can construct a filter that will preferentially ionise synthetic molecules and thus deliver to you your cylons.
we have five warheads left aboard this ship.
adama: we may need them.
baltar: yes, of course.
if you really think that this project has a low priority then you're totally within your bounds to  you'll get your warhead.
good boy.
thank you, commander.
tyrol: look, the master-at-arms has been over every inch of that locker.
she's come up with nothing.
boomer: so they've got no idea who took those six g-4 charges or who put that detonator in don't worry about it.
i'll take care of it, okay?
i need to speak with the lieutenant, alone.
you don't honestly think you've been fooling everyone, do you?
i know.
the old man knows.
tigh: hell, the whole ship knows about you and the chief.
it stops.
now.
sir, the chief and i are just friends.
when the ship was being decommissioned, we let it go.
hell, we let people get away with murder.
that was then and this is now.
we're at war, this is a combat unit and you're his superior officer.
put a stop to it.
that's an order.
yes, sir.
gaeta:  attention.
pass the word for col.
tigh.
col.
tigh, please report to the cic.
zarek:  the crew are my prisoners.
they will not be harmed.
adama: are you recording this? gaeta: yes, sir.
tigh: what's this? adama: trouble.
zarek:  but i have two conditions before i release my captives.
first, the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate and it must submit to the will of the people.
i demand the immediate resignation of laura roslin and her ministers.
second, i demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership.
and a new government that represents all of the people.
these demands are made not for me or the former slaves held on this ship but for you, the people, the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanity's future.
i am tom zarek and this is the first day of the new era.
we've jammed his transmissions.
a little bit late for that.
every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
it doesn't matter.
it does matter.
he's trying to bring down the government.
adama: no one'll take it seriously.
you have something to learn when it comes to public opinion, commander.
tom zarek is a name with weight.
he's a very sympathetic figure.
a legend, almost.
twenty years in prison over a matter of principle.
he's a criminal and a terrorist.
people won't give him credence.
roslin: don't be so sure, commander.
rebellions are contagious.
people are already rioting over the water crisis.
we can't afford to destabilise this government right now.
adama: i agree.
roslin: when are you going in? i assumed you were gonna talk to him first.
we don't negotiate with terrorists.
i said talk.
there's nothing to talk about.
what he wants, i can't give him.
we're not ready yet.
talking to zarek gives us a little bit more time.
that's what he wants, legitimacy. he wants to be recognised.
he wants his crimes validated.
i watched president adar offer him a full pardon if he'd apologise and give up violence as a means of political change.
he refused.
no commitments.
no deals.
i'll let you know what happens.
three assault teams: alpha, bravo, constellation.
we jam their dradis, the raptors cut through the hull here, here and here without being seen.
once we're inside, alpha takes what's this we crap?
i'm going, sir.
like hell.
we have a few marines left on galactica.
let them handle it, starbuck.
they don't have a sniper.
with all due respect, i'm the best shot in or out of the cockpit.
she's right.
for once.
wonders never cease.
all right, you're going in.
you get a clear shot at zarek, you take it.
i wanna control that ship immediately.
and i want all the hostages alive.
yes, sir.
i don't even know how i drew this detail.
president thought you'd be valuable.
president doesn't know who i am.
i told her. sorry.
on the other hand, it's nice to get out of the cic.
break up the day, meet new people.
yeah.
mason: you're not asleep.
cally: not anymore.
mason: is that your way of telling us you're not scared?
no, it's my way of telling you i'm tired.
you don't know what tired is.
right.
don't!
don't mock me, little girl.
i'm not mocking you.
mason: tom and i, we go way back.
long time.
if you know what's good for you, you'll be nice to me.
frequent wireless contact.
tigh: keep us informed all the way.
starbuck: yes, sir.
good hunting.
who voted for laura roslin?
you? did you vote for her? she was sworn in under the law.
the answer is, no one voted for her. and yet she's making decisions for all of us, deciding who lives and who dies. is that democracy? is that a free society?
what is it you want from me? you want me to say she shouldn't be president?
we need a government.
we need rules, we need a leader.
we need to be free men and women.
if we're not free, then we're no different than cylons.
zarek: they call you apollo.
apollo: it's my call sign.
apollo's one of the gods.
a lord of kobol.
you must be a very special man to be called a god.
it's just a stupid nickname.
son of zeus, good with the bow, god of the hunt and also a god of healing.
now, a god can reconcile those two opposing forces, but a mortal has to pick one side or the other.
have you picked a side, apollo?
astral queen, this is the battlestar galactica.
commander adama wishes to speak to mr. zarek.
please respond.
zeus is calling.
zarek:  commander adama?
tom zarek.
how can i help you?
first, i want to make sure that my people are unharmed.
this is apollo.
i'm fine, so are the others.
apollo: they're located on the lower zarek: that's enough, thank you. i'm glad to hear that no one's been hurt.
that would have tragic consequences.
how long until you storm the ship?
i'm ho that won't be necessary.
i think that you and i can come up with some kind of understanding.
this is not the only crisis that i'm dealing with.
the water shortage affects the entire fleet.
your men are on their way even as we speak.
there's still time to work this out.
have the president step down and call for elections.
that's not gonna happen.
then i look forward to meeting your men.
i knew you were faking.
i'm a light sleeper.
i don't think i have your respect.
i respect you.
get up.
billy: hey, what's going on?
hey!  what are you doing?
move.
dualla: where are you taking her? it's okay, cally.
you're gonna be okay.
they know where we are, cally.
capt.
adama!
hey! capt.
adama!
they're willing to talk.
sounded that way.
you want them to storm the ship.
soft seal.
pressurised.
eyes.
that's it, isn't it?
you don't want elections, you don't want your freedom.
you want a bloodbath.
you don't understand.
tom zarek's been out of the headlines, out of the news forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell.
now he's got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory and he's gonna take it.
alpha one, we're in.
once roslin uses adama's soldiers to massacre the people on this ship prisoners and hostages alike people in the fleet will never forgive them.
the entire government will collapse.
she can take care of herself.
you sure? she's been trained.
we've all been trained in capture, it's  you've been saying everything you're doing is for freedom.
apollo: but the truth is it's all about tom zarek and his personal death wish.
seaborne: tom.
something's up.
mason: frakking bitch!
zarek: that's mason.
what the hell.
they're killing the hostages.
let's go.
constellation team, set.
zarek: mason!
zarek: mason, what're you doing?
bit my ear off.
frak you! apollo: open the door, she's been shot!
you said they weren't animals.
what do you call this? mason: twenty years i've been waiting!
apollo: he's gonna kill her.
do something.
you did this!
you put him in a cage!
you made him a monster!
bravo, set.
you filthy bitch!
you all deserve to die!  you first.
starbuck: all teams, sniper in position.
he's gonna do it.
you reap what you sow.
you look at me. you see me! look at me!     come on, lee.
take out the son of a bitch.
how about it, tom? you still have a death wish?
you ready to leave this world, right here, right now? yes.
too bad.
'cause this is what you're gonna do.
apollo: you're gonna tell your men to help us get that water off the moon.
apollo: they're gonna work for their points.
apollo: and they're gonna earn their freedom.
and then you're gonna get your elections.
what?
'cause you're right, tom.
you are right about democracy and consent of the people.
i believe in those things, and we're gonna have them.
and you can have them, too.
or you can have this bullet.
your call.
what are you doing, lee? come on.
how do i know your father and the president will honour your word?
you don't.
you let the rest of the hostages go, we'll leave this ship in your hands.
they try and come after you, you can still have your last stand.
it's your choice.
you reap what you sow.
all right.
zarek: lower your weapons.
zarek: lower your weapons.
prisoner: do what he says.
put them down.
apollo: back off.
apollo: cally, you're gonna be okay.
you just hang in there, you hear? starbuck: got you.
apollo: cease fire!  prisoner: don't shoot!
starbuck: all teams, hold positions.
frak.
thanks.
i need a medic here.
god.
i don't believe this.
it's unacceptable.
it's done.
prisoners have full control of the astral queen.
we evac'ed all the s and support personnel.
it's their ship.
they're a threat to the entire fleet.
they've been disarmed.
the ship itself has no weapons.
the ship itself is a weapon!
they're totally dependent on us for food, fuel and they've agreed to organise the workforce for the water detail on the moon.
you've committed me to holding elections within a year.
madam president, with respect you're serving out the remainder of president adar's term.
when that term is up in seven months, the law says there's an election.
i only committed you to obeying the law.
you were not authorised to make any deal.
you sound like a lawyer.
i swore an oath to defend the articles.
the articles say there's an election in seven months.
if you're saying the law's out, then i'm not a captain, you're not a commander and you are not the president.
and i don't owe either of you a damned explanation for anything.
he's your son.
he's your advisor.
an election.
i guess you finally picked your side.
adama: madam president.
what the hell is this?
water?
bet your ass.
there's plenty more where that came from.
i have my flaws, too. the difference is, my flaws are personal, yours are professional.
thank you, lieutenant.
that'll be all.
specialist lazy, how are you feeling? must be nice lying around, doing nothing, as usual.
sorry, chief.
i didn't think you'd find me here.
tyrol: i am so on to you.
socinus: cally, is it true?
socinus: you really bite that guy's ear off? cally: he's lucky that's all i bit off.
that's my girl.
i'm sorry, i can come back.
no, it's all right.
come on in.
i just wanted to say goodbye before i head back to galactica.
and to tell you i hope you understand, i wasn't being disloyal, madam president.
i understand.
you're upholding the law.
i admire it.
i believe in you. in what you're doing.
and for what it's worth, seven months from now, you'll have my vote.
could you sit? there's something i need to tell you. the truth is, i might not be here in seven months.
are you planning a vacation?
i wish.
i told your father that i  had allergies, but i have cancer.
roslin: i found out the morning of the attack.
i'm so sorry, madam president.
i don't know what to say.
roslin: i understand.
i'm going to fight this, but there is a great need for secrecy. of course.
whether or not i survive this illness it is of great importance to me that there's a future for the people.
and i fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope.
so this has to stay between you and me.
you can count on me.
i know i can.
you're capt.
apollo.
.
male narrator previously on battlestar galactica.
this will be adama's command until the day he dies.
and we are not going to let him die.
gaeta sir, what about our people on the surface of kobol?
tigh if they're still alive, they'll have to wait, el-tee, i think we should double-check the supplies before we bug out.
we don't have the time, chief.
i could give you a shot, but you wouldn't like the side effects.
just do it.
the time is going to come when you're not going to be able to hide what you're going through.
his lungs are filling up with fluid, if he doesn't get more serisone soon he's not gonna make it.
tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you've got to go back and get it.
take a rifle, two clips of ammo and a canteen.
seelix it's too late.
he's not gonna make it.
crashdown i'm sorry, chief.
crashdown lords of kobol take these brave men into your arms.
take up.
take the spirits of our fallen friends so that they may share in the everlasting life that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears.
so say we all.
all so say we all.
nothing awaits them.
no eternal life.
no damnation.
only oblivion.
because they haven't seen the face of god, i take it?
because they died here, on kobol.
i see.
tyrol doc, let's go.
we're moving out.
doc, you hear me? we're moving out.
no, i did hear you, chief.
i just don't respond to the title doc. a dock is a platform for loading and unloading material.
my title is doctor or mr.
vice president, if you don't mind.
you are loading, are you not? tyrol el-tee?
el-tee?
crash!
yeah, chief, i'll be right there.
no cylons.
crashdown you sure?  wait a minute.
tree line, 2:00.
got them.
what're they doing?
tyrol looks like they're dismantling the ship.
crashdown why? why not use it to fly the hell out of here?
i don't know.
i can't tell.
they're dragging it into the tree line.
oh, wait a minute.
they're building something.
chief, is that a. a missile.
they're building a missile battery.
well, at least we know why they're not chasing us.
why? why aren't they chasing us? because they don't have to.
they can just sit back, launch a missile barrage that'll wipe out every living thing in this valley.
next time i say i'm in a hurry, cycle the damn airlock faster.
is this your first day?
dr.
cottle, thank the gods you're here.
the president needs your help.
move!
doctor.
doctor!
okay.
let's have some vitals.
like now.
kim two bullets, mm.
this one lacerated the spleen, the other nicked the aorta.
now, we've removed the spleen and felt we repaired the aorta-- over the past few hours, his b.p '. dropped down again.
it's only 80/40, and his heart rate's cree back into the 130s.
well, you missed something.
he's still hemorrhaging somewhere.
we're gonna lose him unless we can stop that bleeding.
get me an abg, cbc and coags and get set up for a rapid sequence intubation. is he gonna make it?
how should i know?
i'm not a psychic.
now get the hell out of here.
cottle it's a mess in here.
looks like the mesenteric artery may have been damaged.
gods damn it, kim, learn the instruments!
i said a 3.7 mac! kim sorry.
clamp it.
clamp!
lshay dr.
cottle, his pressure's drop.
it's 60/30.
heart rate's starting to fall.
i don't think he can last much longer.
just stay focused.
get some more suction in here so i can see what i'm doing.
colonel, how's the commander?
what?
how's the commander?
he's still in surgery.
what's on your mind?
i need some medication for the president.
she's not the president anymore.
cottle's a little busy right now.
sir, she's very ill-- why aren't you in the brig?
because no one put me in there.
what the hell's all this?
why aren't you in the brig?
i'm on duty, sir.
planning the search and rescue mission.
search and rescue?
for who? we lose a plane and nobody tells me? for our raptor crew down on the surface of kobol, sir.
simes is senior pilot now. he can plan the sar.
you asked me to command the air group when i'm on duty, and i'm on duty so am i in command or not?
what's the status of the sar, captain?
apollo well, we don't know in what area raptor went down.
so the only realistic chance we have of finding her is the hope that her transponder or disaster beacon is still functioning.
i intend to take two raptors one with medical personnel, and make five low-level orbits of the planet.
what about that cylon base ship that lt.
valerii supposedly destroyed?
what if she was lying?
racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship and i checked the gun-camera footage from the raptors, which verifies it.
lt.
gaeta, why are you hovering about?
it's the press.
the press?
they're demanding to know how much longer we plan on holding them and when they can contact their home-ships.
they demand?
they're in no position to demand anything.
you tell them to shut their yaps.
we'll get to them in due time.
dualla excuse me, colonel.
shuttle from the zephyr has just requested permission to enter the landing pattern.
the zephyr?
yes, sir.
evidently the quorum of twelve is aboard.
they're demanding to see you.
they demand?
demanding job, commanding a battlestar.
clear them to land.
put them in the ward room and hold them there until i have time to see them.
stop!
madam president?
what's wrong with her? i don't know, but she's clearly sick.
you can see that, can't you? but there's nothing i can do.
madam president?
yes.
can i get you anything while you're in the brig?
billy.
no, thank you. i'm sorry.
i'm finding it hard to think.
it's withdrawal.
the chamalla, yes.
i'm trying to get you more.
go fast.
i count six missiles being carried into the forest site so far.
it's all so pointless.
we kill them, and they kill us.
so we kill more of them and so they kill more of us.
what's the point anymore?
you, your race invented murder.
invented killing for sport, greed, envy.
it's man's one true art form.
you've done some killing of your own, i think.
yes, well, we're your children.
you taught us well.
why does god want to bring a child into this kind of world, anyway?
because despite everything, despite all of it, he still wants to offer you salvation.
our child will bring that salvation, but only if you accept your role as her father and her ian.
i'm not ready for that, all right?
i'm not a father, i'm not a ian.
i'm not a moral leader capable of leading anyone, let alone a baby.
be a man, gaius.
what?
be a man.
whatever else you are, you are that.
the time is coming when you'll have to act like one.
tyrol wait a minute, wait a minute.
el-tee, check this out.
crashdown what do you got, chief?
east of the launcher, you see that tree stump?
what the hell is that? it looks like a dradis dish or at least a cylon version of a dradis dish.
it's probably salvaged from the nose cone of a ship.
they are building an anti-aircraft battery.
anti-aircraft? for what?
there are no other aircraft around here.
the galactica's gonna send a search and rescue team.
when they do, that's at least two raptors doing a low pass over the crash site.
when those raptors come looking for us, risking their lives to rescue us-- the cylons will shoot them down.
seven birds down for repairs.
three out on picket duty with the cap.
com traffic, sir.
priority messages are on top.
cut to the chase, captain.
how long before you launch the sar? come on, dee, these are all marked priority.
sorry, sir.
that's how they came in.
i'm cannibalizing should be up in the air in, i don't know, 90 minutes.
we got men down on that frakking planet!
get your head in the game.
you do your job or go back to the brig.
are all the members of the quorum in the ward room?
all 12, sir.
don't suppose you want to do this for me? never was much at public speaking, sir.
so why are we here?
that's what i want to know.
what exactly is going on?
we have been cooped up in-- laura roslin suborned mutiny and sedition aboard this ship.
she caused a key military asset to be lost at a critical moment.
the commander felt he had no choice but to remove her from power.
you've said that.
several times.
well, l-- you don't seem to be listening, colonel.
it does not matter what adama felt, he had absolutely no authority-- adama knew exactly what he was doing. he was paving the way to declare martial law and usher in a military dictatorship.
isn't that right, colonel?
tigh i can't speak for the commander.
he's still in surgery.
well, you seem to be giving the orders around here so what exactly are you planning to do? are you declaring martial law? absolutely not.
i know for a fact that the old man hated the very idea of martial law. he believed in freedom and democracy, and all that good stuff.
well, since this is still a democracy and all that good stuff i move that the quorum demand immediate access to president roslin.
excellent.
i second it.
porter all those in favor?
all aye.
zarek aye.
motion carries.
colonel, we demand immediate access to the president.
i will take your demand under advisement.
ellen madam president.
anything that impedes that understanding.
madam president?
i have to consider-- laura?
laura?
hello.
hi. are you all right?
i just came down to see if there was anything i could do for you.
anything i can get you?
i would like to have a conversation with my attorney.
could you arrange that?
yeah, sure, right.
laura, do you know where you are? i'm in jail.
what's my name?
have we met? i'm sorry.
excuse me.
it's just the ringing.
excuse me. the ringing?
right.
okay, then.
take care.
oh, my gods.
ellen tigh.
ellen?
ellen.
lords of kobol.
crashdown the launcher looks like a simple point and shoot no built-in guidance.
tyrol ordnance appear to be standard ship-to-ship missiles.
they're modifying it for atmospheric flight.
cally one cylon centurion walks the perimeter stop at regular intervals.
baltar the dradis dish that controls the missiles is on a 4.5 kg wavelength, judging by the diameter.
it's ed by two centurions, i think.
sorry, doc, did you say it was ed by two centurions?
yes, i did.
okay. is the dradis ed continuously or intermittently?
i saw two centurions, through the field glasses, continuously for five minutes. in that time they didn't leave their post.
so there's three toasters near the launcher, two more out by the dish.
that's a lot of cylons.
you ever handle a weapon?
who, me? no.
i'm not a soldier, crashdown.
i'll try to give you the most simple assignment but i'm going to need every man.
tyrol you're not suggesting we attack the cylons?
we owe it to socinus and tarn to take those frakkers out before they kill anyone else.
we have equal numbers.
we have the element of surprise.
therefore we have the initiative.
we can attack at a time and place of our choosing.
el-tee, a word in private.
he's crazy.
i'm not trained for this kind of thing.
i've never fired a gun in my life.
i haven't fired one since basic.
you? i just joined to pay for dental school.
basic ground assault was a long time ago for all of us.
those aren't training officers out there they're programmed killing machines.
we don't have any choice.
galactica will definitely be sending a search and rescue party.
it's just a matter of time.
if we don't take out that launcher-- we can't go up against an armed and defended position like that.
they'll wipe us out in the first two minutes.
that's enough! chief, look, under the circumstances, it's important that you keep your cool.
i don't believe i've lost my cool.
i disagree.
look, i don't want to attack the launcher, either, but it's our duty.
we owe it to the rescue party, and we owe it to socinus and tarn.
i fail to see what this has to do with socinus and tarn.
maybe that's why i'm an officer and you're not.
dismissed.
crashdown this briefing will outline a plan of attack in five graphs.
graph 1: situation.
our situation is that we are stranded on kobol with a group of five cylons who are planning to use an aau to destroy any sar aircraft sent to find us.
there are no other friendly forces present.
what's all this graph business?
graph 2: mission.
it's a five paragraph order.
to destroy the aau.
it's a basic command tool.
it's taught at officer candidate school.
it's just not usually used this literally in the field.
graph 4: execution.
we will assault the cylon launch site from the northwest, using-- oh, come on!
this is absurd.
what, we're taking on the cylon army, are we?
us? look at us.
what, with two rifles and a canteen?
have you lost your mind-- that's enough, doctor.
is it?
look, no disrespect, but why are we always going uphill?
does anyone else think that his plan is frakking nuts?
i'll tell you what's fair, this is fair.
we'll have a show of hands.
no! absolutely not! now everybody who thinks it's unfair-- this is not a democracy.
well, it's not-- the el-tee's in charge.
the el-tee's in charge.
no ifs, no ands, no buts.
he say we go, we go! there's no questions.
we've already lost two men, chief!
how many more people are we gonna lose?
you need to sit down and shut up right now.
nobody tells me to shut up.
i am the vice president-- you need to sit down and shut up, right now.
your briefing, el-tee.
thank you, chief.
graph 4: we will approach the cylon launch site from the northwest using natural ground cover to mask our approach.
our objective is the command and control console.
once we reach this position cally, you're gonna flank out to the left making a feint on the cylon position hopefully drawing their fire long enough for me and seelix to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console.
tyrol, you and the vice president will stay at position one provide covering fire for both flanking maneuvers.
i have been given the opportunity to perceive from the scriptures. in peace i believe.
this is ridiculous.
look.
she obviously needs her medication.
i keep trying to tell anyone that'll listen-- it sounds like she's talking about the scrolls of the prophet pythia.
i suppose.
pythia foretold the rise of a leader.
a leader who would lead all humanity to salvation.
so say the gods.
you seem to know a lot about the scriptures.
i'm from gemenon.
we believe in the literal truth of the scriptures.
cpl.
venner, there's a drug that priests sometimes use.
it's called chamalla extract.
i guess it's happy hour.
what's happy about it?
yeah.
the old man's still in surgery.
i got a boatload of politicians and press demanding to see laura roslin.
let them.
yeah, right.
she's crazy.
i know.
no, no, really, saul.
she's lost it.
i just went down to the brig to see her. you did? she's completely nuts.
she doesn't even know where she is anymore.
you're kidding.
you should let them see her. the press, the quorum, all of them.
i mean, the little school teacher's mind has gone bye-bye and the vice president is either missing or dead.
that leaves you in unchallenged command of this ship and this fleet.
just until the old man gets back on his feet.
well, of course.
apollo galactica, apollo, we are preparing to jump to kobol, roger that, apollo.
you are cleared to jump.
good hunting.
thank you, galactica, let's go find our people.
okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
cock the rifle.
no.
one of you will turn against the others.
during the mission?
yes.
one of us will betray the others?
yes.
during the attack?
yes.
but if the attack fails?
you'll die.
not me.
i am god's instrument.
god turned his back on kobol.
turned his back on man and the false gods he worshipped.
what happens on kobol is not his will.
crashdown saddle up.
it's time to junk some toasters.
xo.
dualla combat, dualla here, sir, the quorum is demanding to see the former president.
they're being pretty adamant, and they're giving the sentries a hard time.
well, maybe we should tell them to shove their demand up their collective asses.
how about that?
yes, sir.
i need instructions for the sentries.
they're asking how to respond, tell them that they are going to get to see what has become of their precious president.
you tell them that.
i got a transponder signal.
definitely colonial.
trying to establish a lock.
got it.
northern hemisphere.
looks like mountainous terrain.
there's a valley.
take us out of orbit.
signal raptor to form up on us.
there they are, all three of them, right where they're supposed to be.
all right, people.
this is it.
we're going in.
cally, you move up the tree line to point alpha.
whoa, el-tee.
there's five cylons at the launcher.
what?
something's wrong, isn't it?
something's wrong with the plan?
quiet down, there's nothing wrong.
there's just a couple cylons that we didn't account for.
that makes for seven cylons, five here and two up at the dish.
are you absolutely certain about the two s at the dish?
i know what i saw.
maybe there are only five cylons.
they just changed their deployment.
they brought the two that were ing the dish down here.
now the dish is unprotected.
god, chief, that dish is, like, almost a klick away.
so what?
it's unprotected.
we can go take it out.
we don't have to take on the whole cylon army.
what the hell was that?
sonic booms.
spacecraft entering the upper atmosphere.
it's the sar mission.
they're here.
they're right up there, chief.
we got to go.
there's no time for discussion.
all right, everyone up, move out.
it's game time.
we're taking out these toasters before they kill any more of us.
cally, i said move.
i can't.
what?
that's an order.
she doesn't have to.
we could just go take out the dish!
cally, you have to move.
cally, this is not a joke.
go! this is not a game, cally, go! we have people counting on us.
they're up there, cally.
move!
listen to me, we still have time to double back and take out the dish.
shut up for a second, cally.
cally.
specialist, you have your orders.
i need you to go up there and create a distraction, now! move!
move!
el-tee.
there were only supposed to be three cylons and now there are five.
how are we supposed to take on five cylons?
frak orders, frak court martial!
our people are up there, we have to save them.
we don't have any time.
move!
i can't do it.
cally!
move!
no! chief!
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
put it down.
put it down.
you are going out there, cally.
you're going out there, or i'm going to blow your brains out.
right here, right now.
put it down.
hey, el-tee, easy.
take it easy.
i'm gonna count to three.
this is crazy, this is crazy!
one.
put it down.
right now.
seelix oh, my gods!
listen to me! drop your weapon!
two.
three.
tyrol fall back!
fall back!
go! go! go! come on, doc! let's go! now you're a man.
eta? five minutes.
seelix cally!
oh, cally!
doc! give me the launcher!
give me the launcher, doc! come on!
tyrol cover me!  missiles!
there's a battery down there!
evasive!
break!
break!
break!
racetrack break formation.
no lock!
no lock!
they're not locking on us!    cally chief!
stay there!
stay there!
chief!
chief!
you're welcome.
viewing time at the zoo.
glad to see you hold the president in such high esteem.
your day's gonna come,  boy.
let's go.
porter what is she saying?
bagot i don't know.
she's not saying anything.
i don't know what to do.
i feel like she's.
all right, the show's over.
let's give her some privacy.
everybody out.
let's go back to the ward room and we'll talk about the business of how we proceed from here.
thank you all for coming.
i have a statement i'd like to make. the attempted military coup against the lawful government of the colonies is illegal, ill-advised, and clearly doomed to failure.
i have not resigned the presidency, and i will fight this action with everything at my command.
she's crazy.
she's nuts.
she thinks she's a prophet or some such nonsense.
go ahead and ask her.
ask her, she'll tell you.
just listen to her. what was it?
the arrow of apollo will open the tomb of artemis, or some such nonsense.
everything i have done is consistent, logical.
we have found kobol.
we have found the city of the gods.
and when we retrieve the arrow, we will open the tomb of athena and we will find the road to earth.
madam president, have you read the scrolls of pythia?
carefully and many times, and i humbly believe that i am fulfilling the role of the leader.
okay, enough of this nonsense.
everybody out.
i don't think so.
wait a minute.
wait a minute!
sarah, you represent gemenon, you know more about the scrolls and the scriptures than anybody else here.
why don't you speak up? the scrolls tell us that a dying leader will lead us to salvation.
she's not dying, she's crazy.
i am dying.
i have terminal breast cancer.
dr.
cottle will verify the diagnosis.
i have a few months to live.
and in that time, i will lead the people to salvation.
it is my sole purpose.
praise be to the gods.
here is our salvation.
sergeant of the !
sergeant yes, sir.
remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle.
thank you, corporal.
thank the gods.
it's a hell of a butcher's bill, chief.
how did crashdown die?
leading the charge.
he gave his life in the finest tradition of the service.
yeah. he was a hero to the end.
i'm so proud of you, gaius.
why? because i've taken a life? it makes you human. is it not conscious thought not poetry, or art, or music, literature.
murder.
murder is my heritage.
is that the lesson i'm supposed to pass on to our child?
it'll be all right, gaius.
hey, doctor, let's go! doctor, come on!
we got to go! i'll be your conscience.
apollo come on, doctor!
we got to get out of here!
he'll live.
when will he wake up? knowing him, when he damn well wants to, probably.
i really frakked things up for you, bill.
the events which took place aboard colonial one are unfortunate, laura roslin's actions in suborning mutiny and sedition,,, among the military could not be tolerated, therefore, commander adama was left with no choice,,, other than to remove her from office, miss roslin is now resting comfortably aboard this ship,,, where she will remain until such time as the commander deems otherwise,  as it appears obvious that the government,,, cannot function under the current circumstances,,, i have decided to dissolve the quorum of twelve,,, and as of this moment, i have declared martial law,  get those people the hell off my ship.
yes, sir.
previously on battlestar galactica we're cylons.
and we have been from the start.
it's time for a change.
i've had some feelers from the government.
i think i could make a valuable contribution there.
i'm giving you a ship.
now go find a way to earth.
there are five other cylons, brother.
i saw them.
yes, we know.
that's why we've decided to box your entire line.
the telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the centurions?
we had them removed.
say what?! welcome back, brother.
what happened?
you were shot, but you're with us now.
shot by who? by our own centurions.
that's pure insanity.
the sixes have lost their minds.
they have no idea of the threat that they've unleashed.
i need to get to my ship.
it's not your ship anymore.
the sixes and their acolytes used their new pets to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.
the fleet's split right down the middle.
so much for my swing vote.
that'll teach me not to trust in democracy.
they can't possibly need you every single hour of every single day.
can't you just tell someone to fill in for you?
who, cally?
who's gonna fill in for me? i don't know!
anyone can frakkin' turn a wrench down there.
there's not i'm the chief of the frak i've had enough of this.
yes! dualla, it's me again.
no, i know, i'm sorry.
can you please just check?
i used to know who i was.
galen tyrol.
crew chief, husband, father.
i look in the mirror nowadays, i don't even know what i am. are you and cally getting along?
you know, i never really liked ambrosia before.
but now it's like i'm being flooded with new sensations and new feelings.
maybe you are too.
in some ways, i don't hate this.
feeling new.
feeling open to things.
to change.
i don't do well with change.
galen, you son of a cally, come here.
just give her some room.
let go of me! let go! just listen to me for a second.
cally, listen to me.
battlestar galactica season - episode transcript = swsub.com
- thanks, insults, critics the nausea should go away in about an hour.
love and bullets, by nick talo.
chapter one.
it started like it always did. with a body.
this one was in the river.
i could tell she had once been beautiful.
but this a bullet and fast current had taken away from her. all we are, all that we think we are, all that we are certain about is taken away from us. when you've worked the streets and seen what i've seen, you become more and more convinced of it every day.
caprica city had been my teacher, my mistress.
from the moment i open my eyes, she's in my blood, like cheap wine bitter and sweet, tinged with regret.
i'll never be free of her, nor do i want to be. for she is what i am.
all that is should always be. i am grateful and consistently inspired by the compassionate and forthright leadership of president roslin.
by the wisdom of my father, whom some of you may know.
and by the support and advice of my valued friends.
some of whom, you may be shocked to hear, are not capricans.
and so i am honored to accept this appointment to the quorum in the hope that i can continue delegate cowan's courageous work on behalf of the people of caprica and the fleet.
thank you. madam president, by confirming mr.
adama's nomination, does it mean you don't have any hard feelings about his role in the baltar trial?
thank you very much.
mr.
adama took on a cause he felt was important.
and i fully trust he will continue to bring the same passion and clear-mindedness in representing his constituents.
yes? what about the demetrius?
the sewage recycling freighter that jumped away three weeks ago.
i will ask admiral adama to answer that question.
the demetrius is on a military mission.
what about the rumor that kara thrace was put in charge of that mission?
i don't comment on rumors.
i'm gonna have to cut this short.
i will see you all very soon at the quorum q&a.
thank you very much.
frankly, i'm surprised it took them this long to come after us about the demetrius.
any luck and it'll blow over.
it's not going to blow over.
i'm gonna be covering for you for a long time on this.
i wanted to give kara a chance.
i wanted to give myself a chance to believe in her.
apparently.
you wanted to see me, sir? i've made a decision.
caps and recon runs.
okay, anyone want to remind me what we're supposed to be looking for?
didn't you get the commander's memo?
it's a unique astronomic cluster.
a system with a ringed gas giant, trinary star, and a comet.
astronomic cluster.
sounds more like a cluster frak.
that's enough of that crap.
sorry, sir, but you gotta admit it's starting to feel like we're flying around in circles.
what's the latest, felix?
she's reversing course, returning to sector seven.
that is the tenth course correction.
did she give a reason this time?
a reason?
let's just say i think she's steering with her gut.
frak me.
i'm telling you guys, this thing is a setup anyway.
you think that the old man just gave her the ship and then cut her loose?
i guarantee you galactica's dogging our every move, and they're waiting to jump in as soon as she shows her true colors.
you don't know what you're talking about.
you gonna tell me what i know, rook?
yeah, maybe.
i said to can it!
all of you! helo, i need to talk to you.
now! who wants odds on a course correction then?
kara, hey, listen.
some of us have been wondering about this trinary star formation we're supposed to be looking for.
is there anything else you can tell us about it?
any new data?
anything at all? you know everything you need to know, ensign.
so stow the questions and do your job.
yes, sir.
what's up, captain?
helo, i have new jump coordinates.
double check the data file and the ftl drive.
got it?
cally, i told you last night and i'm telling you again right now.
i am not having an affair.
i went out for a drink.
i ran into tory.
we started talking.
look, i know how it looks, but it's completely innocent.
there's nothing to it.
you'll have to drop nicky off.
i have a doctor's appointment.
can you tell them not to feed him any of that algae mash?
i think he's allergic.
just remember about the algae.
no, i'm sorry.
daddy's sorry.
hey, come here.
i'm sorry.
i see you're still cleaning up your mess.
oh, i hardly think this qualifies as our mess.
well, i guess that explains why none of you are lending a hel hand.
really, six, if you had wanted some room to spread out, you could've just asked. is there anything that isn't fodder for a joke with you? or is that really how you see our very existence?
as some sort of nihilistic punch line?
nihilistic punch line?
i like that.
but quite honestly, i'm feeling very serious.
getting riddled with bullets affects me that way.
but i want you all to know that i place the blame for all of this squarely on myself.
go on.
well, you had legitimate concerns, but i refused to hear them.
but now i'm listening.
so tell me, what's to be done to stop all this and let us get back together?
well, for starters, you can stop lobotomizing the raiders.
done.
and you can agree to unbox the d'annas.
resurrect her entire line?
don't forget, six, it was d'anna's messianic quest for secrets better left alone that started us down this divisive path in the first place.
you talk about restoring our unity.
well, we think it's time to restore our greater unity.
to unite the 12 models once and for all.
well, i don't think the others will accept this, but i'll make your case.
escort him off the ship.
please.
it's a good thing you remembered the magic word.
you're going to find you opened a bigger can of worms than you realize.
inspiring, isn't it?
a government of the people, for the people, and answerable to the people.
at least that's the idea.
i heard you tried to see her. i had some bills i wanted to discuss.
projects delegate cowan was pushing before she died.
but they told me she wasn't in.
she was, just not for you.
by standing up for baltar, you crossed the line with her. and laura roslin is not the type to forgive and forget.
she forgave you.
she made you vice president.
to keep me on the sidelines.
same way she'll try to sideline you.
well, then i'm intrigued.
why did you nominate me in the first place?
because you did stand up for baltar.
and you put roslin on the stand to do it.
you weren't afraid to ask some hard questions and to demand some honest answers.
well, if you're looking for a repeat performance, you're out of luck.
i didn't take this job to help you undermine the president.
i'm not asking you to.
believe it or not, i'm on laura's side.
okay, then what's the problem?
it's amazing the things you start to notice when you're on the sidelines, how every decision that laura and your father make gets stamped classified.
or how her directives are starting to read like decrees, yet still get enacted without so much as a debate.
you know, she won't even allow records to be kept of any of her meetings.
secrecy and control are becoming obsessions for her.
i think this demetrius business is just the tip of the iceberg.
well, sometimes a benevolent tyrant's exactly what you need.
no. a tyrant craves power for its own sake.
and all laura wants is to save us all.
trust me.
better yet, trust yourself.
because that's what i'm really counting on.
that you're not the kind of man who can ignore the truth when it stares you in the face.
what if you gave me a sedative and i just slept here?
oh, sure.
we'll just turn my sickbay in an opium den so you can have a little snooze.
feels like i haven't had a night's sleep since we reached that frakkin' nebula.
how are things on the home front?
you mean other than catching my husband with another woman and having him tell me i'm imagining things? the man doesn't know what he's got at home.
should have his head examined.
as a matter of fact, why don't you bring him in?
i'll take a look.
see, that's what i like about you, doc.
you just pretend to be a bastard.
while you're in the mood for tough love, maybe you are imagining things.
you know, fatigue and antidepressants can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.
i felt like i need to take something to keep from going completely crazy.
you're not crazy.
what would you call someone who all but proposes to a man after he breaks her jaw?
that the last time he laid hands on you? you want to hear something really sick? sometimes i wish he would.
lay hands on me.
at least then i'd i'd know he had some feelings about me.
listen, just get some sleep and clear your head.
will do, doc.
thank you. kara, what the hell's the matter with you? 'cause the way you're holing up in here, you're making people wonder.
let 'em.
frankly, they're starting to bug me as much as i bug them.
frak 'em.
you know, some of us actually volunteered for this mission.
some meaning you? is that what this is about, sam? you want to know what the deal is with us? with our marriage?
well, it didn't make much sense to begin with.
makes even less now.
give me that.
i don't buy that.
i don't think you believe a single frakkin' word you're saying.
you're just scared.
you see that? you see this? you remember those?
do you remember when we got 'em? that's what's real.
that's part of who we are.
that is a part of who you are, whether you want to admit it or not.
you dumb motherfrakker.
i only married you because it was safe and it was easy, sam.
and you were just pathetic enough to go along with it.
so get the frak out.
i said get out.
get out!
i don't want to fight, sam.
i want to frak.
you don't get it, do you?
i'm not the same girl you married.
all i want to do right now is frak.
really frak, like it's the end of the world and nothing else matters.
so come on, sam.
make me feel something.
i dare you.
we were married, weren't we? i mean, that wasn't just like a fantasy.
hell, no. and i got the scars to prove it.
does that seem different to you somehow?
different how? not sure.
it's like everything seems so far away.
the way things feel.
the way they taste.
like i'm watching myself, but i'm not really experiencing it, not living it.
like my body's just this alien thing that i'm still attached to.
does that seem crazy to you? frankly, we were as surprised as you are.
we presented your case.
there was some debate.
and we were outvoted.
our compatriots now seem to agree that it was wrong to box the d'annas.
it sounds like your own opinion hasn't changed.
i promised that we'd do some hard thinking.
but in the end, we decided that our choices were correct.
unfortunately, restoring unity was all the others seemed to care about.
it's hard to have unity when you're so opposed to everything we believe in.
look, he kept his word.
you won the day.
do you think you have the right to win our hearts and minds?
no, you're being presumptuous.
don't compare us to they're right.
if they've agreed to our terms, there's no point in courting any more discord.
any more discord and we may run out of spare bodies.
the three's core consciousness is being downloaded at our central resurrection hub. the nearest accessible server is a half dozen jumps from here.
we can go together and hear what your newfound heroine has to say.
if you don't mind, we'd prefer to stay on our own ships.
by all means.
i'd doubt that the rest of us would feel comfortable here anyway.
the chair recognizes the delegate from sagittaron.
would the president care to comment on the news stories crediting so-called military sources that claim the demetrius is searching for new food sources?
or, madame president, would you rather that we just simply accept this obvious attempt at disinformation?
order, please.
i'm afraid i don't control the media, jacob, as much as you know i'd love to.
regarding the reports, the demetrius mission is a matter of fleet security, and as such i can't and won't discuss it, period.
madame president, i have to say that my constituency is not satisfied do you realize this casts doubt on something as fundamental as our route to earth?
yes, but don't take my yes to imply that the rumors are true.
madame president! jacob, aaron, everyone, please.
i can not believe that the demetrius is the only matter that is important to your constituents.
can we please move on?
you know my answer to this.
you can tell your free trade deal good-bye.
you can kiss my ass.
order, please.
order!
madame president, i'm sure we can all understand the importance for the need for security.
coming from the military, it's my experience that we sometimes err too strongly on the side of caution.
so, for the sake of reassuring my colleagues and hopefully putting this matter to rest, would it not be fair to say that you and admiral adama are naturally exploring all possible routes to earth?
hear, hear.
now we're getting focus.
that's exactly what we need.
mr.
adama, we are all anxious to receive the benefit of your experience.
but, i personally don't feel the need to have a junior delegate appoint himself my spokesman.
let's move on.
jacob, you had a matter on the table.
would you please continue?
thank you, madame president.
my constituents are having problems obtaining point of order.
now, i have prepared a report that i think we point of order, mister vice president.
excuse me.
hello?
order, please!
order, please!
thank you very, very much.
mr.
cantrell, will you yield the floor?
i will yield.
thank you. this relates to your executive order 112.
which establishes a system of tribunals.
the judges are chosen by you.
answerable only to a special court of appeals, the judges of which would also be chosen by you.
effectively it creates a justice system that further and dangerously concentrates power into the hands of the executive.
namely, into your hands, madame president.
far from being independent or impartial, it would actually damage the very idea of justice.
even the illusion of the idea of justice.
thank you, mr.
adama.
and the order you're referring to, executive order 112, is actually a work in progress, and the changes it proposes are provisional.
it is a first step, a tiny step, but the first step in a in a larger plan, actually, to create a fair and comprehensive legal system, which you of all people can admit we sorely need.
now naturally i was going to bring it to the quorum to open it up for debate once it was finished, which it isn't.
but since you've brought it into the public today, i propose that we put it on the dock for the next full session.
is that satisfactory to you, mr.
adama? the resurrection ship didn't make the jump.
problem with their ftl?
no report.
now cavil's baseships are breaking formation, taking positions around our periphery.
they're going to attack.
alert the others!
we need to jump now.
they've taken out our ftl!
no resurrection ship.
they're trying to kill us.
just remember they started it.
but we're killing them.
we're truly killing them.
my own sisters.
they can trust their god to watch over their immortal souls.
and what about ours? we're machines, dear, remember?
we don't have souls.
now i've heard everything.
anders and gaius frakkin' baltar.
cylon nymphomaniac.
don't worry, colonel.
you're not my type.
and one more thing.
from now on we only meet in private after that scene you two pulled in joe's bar the other night, we can't risk any more attention.
fine, great.
we done, can we go? why are you so antsy?
i told cally i'd check on her.
well, didn't you do that when you got my note?
what note? the note i left in the drop in your quarters about this meeting.
tory found me.
did you frak me.
if cally finds the note then you better hope she doesn't.
and you better put an end to this affair business.
whatever it takes to stop her from nosing around.
last thing we need is for your cylon-hating wife to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs running around this ship and that her husband is one of them.
i'm tired of looking at your sorry faces.
frak! frak! how you doing?
fine.
you feeling okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
sure?
yeah, actually, i am.
thought i was coming down with something, so i slept in.
did you go see cottle?
no, i'm feeling better.
good.
look, i know it's been a rough couple of weeks.
i know what you're thinking.
it's not true.
it isn't?
no.
i'm not having an affair.
i figured it out.
i know what's important.
you're important.
nicky's important.
we're important.
us.
that's really what it's all about, isn't it?
a family, a future.
building that future together.
i promise you from now on i will be here for us. the three of us.
maybe the four of us.
you know, maybe someday we'll have another baby.
what do you think?
another baby? a brother, a sister for little nick? would you like a little brother or sister?
cally!
stay the frak away from me! i know what you are! i know what all of you are.
how could you?
we don't even know what we are.
i heard you.
you're cylons! a bunch of frakkin'skinjobs.
i wish it were that simple.
i told you to stay away from me.
i guess you better hope there's a spare body waiting for you.
you want to kill me? go ahead.
don't do this to yourself or to your child.
to nicky.
get the frak away!
you're not getting your hands on my son! not you or not galen! he frakkin' used me! he didn't know.
none of us did.
we didn't find out until we entered that nebula.
just shut the frak up, triggered!
all we know is that we're cylons.
but in every other way, we're still the same people.
you're frakkin' machines!
i don't know.
but i do know that we're not evil.
we're not inhuman.
and we're just as scared and confused as you are.
i can't live like this! it's a frakkin' nightmare.
you don't want to do this, cally.
he's your son.
what have i done?
i'm so sorry.
it's okay it's gonna be okay.
let's just get out of here.
it's okay.
we'll work this out together.
it's okay.
okay.
here.
let me take him.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
zak failed basic flight.
but he didn't because i passed him.
i can't decode it, but it means there's someone.
someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in caprica.
i have cancer.
and i fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope.
so this has to stay between you and me.
zak was my brother.
what was he to me, nothing?
same old lee.
you haven't changed either.
helmet!
you are so unprepared.
shut up!  you're the worst cag in the history of cags actually.
dualla: raptor pilot lt.
dwight flat-top sanders entering hangar deck 12 b.
deck hands, please report.
dualla: repeat, deck hands, please report to 12 b.
pilot 1: there he is!
pilot 2: way to go, lieutenant!
pilot 1: raptor pilots flying high!
pilots: raptor pilots flying high!
red paint, incoming!
brush?
you're the worst.
the absolute worst!
here.
pilot 1: raptor pilots flying by! pilots: raptor pilots flying by! what the hell is this?
flat-top's 1,000th landing and nobody tells me.
now we look like idiots.
tyrol: find a wagon!
deck hand: yes, sir! somebody get me a wagon!
one, zero, zero.
adama: you're not ready yet?
someone's going to have to pick that up.
stop it!
let's go, come on.
this one is perfect.
take this.
here, give me a hand.
unload this.
put it wherever.
you two, come here.
take this wagon to the palace.
starbuck: did the commander tell you what happened on his 1,000th landing?
i don't remember telling you what i did.
whatever.
starbuck: he's landing on the atlantia and he's been having this ongoing fight with the lso and so he decides he'll stick it to him good.
this has all been over-exaggerated.
pilots: come on, people, watch them bake pilot 1: three little cylons in the air pilots: three little cylons in the air.
pilot 1: watch their metal burn and flare!
so, he skids to a stop on the flight deck and the lso hears over the wire there's this big, loud, long, obnoxious   adama: i was young.
starbuck: it was great.
it was really funny.
pilot 1: two little cylons jump in their cave pilot 1: come on a-cars make their grave!
the lso is freaking out your dad doesn't care because he hates the guy. he figures he can get away with it 'cause it's his 1,000th landing.
i can get away with anything today!
pilots: watch that tin can hit the spot!
pilot 1: five little cylons in the grass pilots: watch the raptor light their ass!
dualla: attention!
fire on the port hangar deck.
dualla: away the fire and rescue team adama: let's go!    metal fatigue, old equipment.
worn strap fails, drops a million cubic drone to the deck.
kills 13 pilots and lands seven more in sick bay.
hadrian: it's hard to hear this, but we got lucky.
if that had been a missile instead of a cone drone it could've taken out the side of the ship.
never had a death in my hangar deck.
accidents.
never a death.
services for the dead.
apollo: services will commence at 1100 hours on the forward hangar deck.
mid-ship's hangar deck remains closed for investigation and clean up until further notice.
uniforms for the services will be dress greys.
i wish i knew what to say, words to make this better.
can anything make this better?
i don't know.
adama: attention on deck! adama: as you were.
adama: may i? apollo: yes, sir.
are you lt.
thrace?
give me your eyes.
i know this has been a hard day.
adama: there's been plenty of them lately.
i can guarantee you there'll be more to come.
adama: remember your self-esteem.
your self-respect.
and your self-worth.
hold strong to them, because people are watching.
you're the ians of the fleet.
they need to know that they can count on you.
adama: even at a time like this.
adama: are you lt.
thrace?
i'm cdr.
adama.
zak's father.
i know, sir.
i'm sorry, sir.
i was planning on coming to see you tomorrow before the funeral.
you don't need to explain anything.
: present arms!
: order arms!
once again, we are charged with the solemn duty to return the bodies of our own to the universe from which the lords of kobol brought them to us.
cleric: the burdens of this life are with us but a short time.
for lt.
zak adama, son of william and caroline adama brother of lee, the time was too short.
cleric: but we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given in service to all of us.
cleric: we honour them for that.
cleric: and, thus, it falls upon us to repent our sins and with the help of the lords of kobol make our own lives worthy of that gift.
cleric: and now, we commit his body to the ground from which we were all made.
elosha: secure in the knowledge that we will be reunited with them in a better world to come.
so say we all.
so say we all.
: present arms!
adama: pilots we've known.
adama: i have to start training new pilots.
there it is.
i kind of thought this was about that.
i don't know if i'm the right person for this.
do you know someone better?
no.
but there's almost 50,000 people out there.
trying to tell me there's not one flight instructor?
there's two.
civilians.
both.
adama: but i need someone to teach combat tactics.
you know, i don't know if i'd be of any use to you.
i wasn't the most patient.
let's get down to it.
this is about zak. it was not your fault.
you had nothing to do with what happened.
it was an accident.
lee? zak failed basic flight.
what? or at least he should have, but he didn't because i passed him.
his technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying but i passed him.
because he and i because i felt something and i let it get in the way of doing my job.
starbuck: and i couldn't fail him.
zak passed basic flight.
adama: he was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit.
what happened to him could've happened to any qualified pilot.
you know that's true.
right.
you did your job to the best of your ability.
that's all i can ask.
i need new pilots.
and i want you to train them.
i can do that.
just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son.
and they'll be one hell of a squadron.
ten cubits says she takes him this time.
you're on.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
ten to stay.
so, gaeta, how are you and the doc here doing on your cylon detector?
what cylon detector?
crashdown: rumour has it that cylons look like people and you guys are working on a way to weed them out, right?
zak: i want you to tell me the truth about something.
starbuck: you passed.
by the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
zak: i don't want any special treatment.
not from my father and certainly not from you.
gaeta: if there were such a programme, it would be classified and i wouldn't be able to talk about it.
baltar: something smells horrible in here.
is that you, crashdown?
crashdown: yeah, that's me.
baltar: your card.
baltar: your card.
zak, i'm a flight instructor.
i'm not going to send you to vipers if i don't think you got the chops.
okay?
hello?
are you all right?
baltar: look  maybe you'd like to take a break?
i'm out of here.
starbuck?
crashdown: okay, she can't do that.
boomer: she can and she did.
boomer: this is it.
helo: restaurant.
boomer: i'm almost on top of the signal.
i don't get it.
how does a military coded signal end up coming from in here?
let's find out.
nothing. is that thing working?
boomer: i checked it three times.
boomer: this thing says we're right on top of it.
helo: of what?
what?
boomer: helo.
helo: you're frackking kidding me.
helo: food.
medical supplies.
helo: wait a minute, the signal.
boomer: disaster beacon.
it's been set to go off if there was an attack.
some poor slob goes to all the trouble of building a fallout shelter, stocks it has a beacon, the whole planet then what? what happens to him?
let's just call ourselves lucky and leave it at that.
madame president.
would you close that curtain, please?
roslin: thank you. you are obviously an intelligent, well-educated young woman.
would you mind explaining to me why you waited five years in between breast exams?
yes, i would mind.
it's none of your business.
i was busy.
and now, here you are.
yes.
here we are.
would you mind?
i do, actually.
your doctor back on caprica was right.
it's too damn late to operate, the cancer is too far advanced.
doc cottle: we can try to shrink the tumour with gamma treatments and follow that up with iv cis-doloxan.
did he explain to you the side-effects of doloxan?
hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.
i watched my mother endure two years of doloxan before she died.
i would like to explore alternate treatment.
doc cottle: prayer?
roslin: witty.
have you ever heard of chamalla extract?
doc cottle: gods.
you're one of those.
roslin: what if it works?
all the evidence on chamalla is anecdotal.
doc cottle: it's nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope.
roslin: i'll take that as a yes.
all right.
i'll put out a med request to the civilian fleet.
maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of chamalla extract in their luggage.
doc cottle: put your clothes back on now.
roslin: thank you. doc cottle: and for what it's worth i would seriously consider prayer.
boonie jumpers.
shuttle jockies.
and a fleet academy wash-out.
this is the best that you could come up with?
diamonds in the rough.
yeah, right.
apollo: they're the most qualified pilots in the fleet.
starbuck: great!
starbuck: attention on deck.
that means get on your feet, nuggets!
you are joining the colonial fleet, boys and girls, not some after-school club.
seats.
starbuck: pilots call me starbuck, but you may refer to me as god.
you've all flown before, but you're about to enter a whole new world so pay attention.
we don't have any flight simulators on board so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.
this is the viper mark ii.
it's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit, and can flip end for end in 0.35 seconds.
you've never flown anything remotely like it, so don't think that you have.
starbuck: today we'll do basic launch, approach, and landing manoeuvres and anyone not paying attention is liable to end up as a puddle or something to be hosed out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.
she's laying it on a little thick.
starbuck: costanza, right?
costanza: yes, god, sir.
not anymore.
from now on, your name is hot dog.
and when god speaks, hot dog, you listen.
maybe if you had learned that at the academy, you wouldn't have washed out.
sit up! lso: viper 791 galactica, you are cleared for approach.
lso: speed 175 port bay, hands on approach checkers green.
call the ball.
i have the ball.
starbuck: easy on the throttle, kat.
starbuck: are you listening to me? don't chase the lights, okay?
kat: roger, starbuck.
starbuck: kat, don't chase the lights!
set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters.
lso: wave-off!
punch it, kat! worse than awful.
wretched beyond belief, actually.
starbuck: you call yourselves pilots. it'll take the knuckle draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck.
with due respect, sir, that's unfair.
yes, sir.
this was only our first day.
no.
it's your last. it would be criminal to let any of you near a viper again.
so pack your gear and get the hell off my ship.
you're done.
what are you doing here, kara?
you can't wash them out on their first day.
i just did.
look, i got 40 vipers, and 21 pilots.
that's it.
we are sitting ducks until we finish water-op's.
we can't even maintain a cap.
and gods forbid the cylons show up.
gods forbid.
let's bring in the next group of candidates.
the next group has never even been in a cockpit.
they're starting basic flight.
then they start basic flight.
because that group is done.
it says so right there.
maybe you should read it again.
apollo: lt.
thrace, this is not a request.
starbuck: well, capt.
adama!
i am the flight instructor, sir.
my word is scripture, sir.
starbuck: i will not, repeat, not pass another student who isn't ready.
so, that's what this is about.
it's not them.
it's zak.
careful.
step back.
adama: starbuck says they can't cut it, they can't cut it.
she's not giving them a chance.
it's day 1. she's one of the finest pilots i've ever seen in my life.
one day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they can hack it or not.
adama: she got that.
apollo: i'm not arguing that, sir.
i'm just saying that i think she's letting her personal feelings cloud her judgment.
please sit down, captain.
adama: what are those feelings?
about zak.
we've talked about, zak.
you did? adama: we've talked about a lot of things.
we've been aboard this ship for over two years.
we know each other very well.
when i asked her to be the instructor i knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage.
she acknowledged it.
she's a professional.
she'll do her job.
okay.
i'm just saying that you should talk to her. apollo: she's walking around with a lot of emotion.
she almost decked me in the rec room.
right.
you wouldn't smile if you were there.
i'll talk to her. thank you. personally i think she's trying to work out her guilt over what she did for zak.
i think she's making up for it by beating up on these guys.
guilt?
over what?
what did she do for zak? i thought you just said what did she do?
it's not my place to say and i've already said more than i should have.
you'll have to ask her.
i'm sorry.
captain, just dad, you'll have to ask her.
zak: i don't want any special treatment.
not from my father, and certainly not from you.
you passed.
by the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
dualla: attention.
pass the word to lt. thrace.
lt.
thrace, please report to the co's quarters.
yes.
come in.
adama: lee was just here before.
starbuck: i knew it.
he thinks you washed out the nuggets without giving them a chance.
they didn't cut it.
that's it.
he thought you were letting personal feelings cloud your judgment.
starbuck: really?
adama: your feelings about zak.
that's not the case.
okay.
adama: he said something else. he said something that i would like to ask you directly.
adama: he said that you might be feeling guilty about something that you did for zak.
what did you do for him?
starbuck: i don't know.
ask lee.
adama: i'm asking you.
i don't know i don't really know what he was talking about, so don't fence with me, kara.
i love you like a daughter.
i don't deserve that.
zak failed basic flight.
he wasn't a bad pilot.
he just had no feel for flying.
and when it came to his final check-ride, he busted three of the test manoeuvres.
and i should have flunked him, but i didn't.
the bottom line is that your son didn't have the chops to fly a viper.
and it killed him.
adama: he told me that you were an amazing instructor.
and that he was involved with you, and that it was serious. he asked me to come to his graduation from flight school to watch him get his wings.
i know.
i read the letter.
i see.
then, maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at.
surprise, about you.
we were going to you know what, it's not important.
i don't want that to you were engaged, right?
you did it because you were engaged.
because i made a mistake.
and because i was just i was so in love with him.
and i let that get in the way of doing my job. he just wanted it so much and i didn't want to be the one who crushed him.
reinstate the trainees to flight status.
i will.
i just want you to understand that i do your job.
yes, sir.
and walk out of this cabin while you still can.
unpack your gear.
you are all returned to flight status.
we're going to try this again.
those of you who can be trained to safely fly the viper mark ii will pass.
those of you who cannot, will be cut.
starbuck: it's my job to figure out which is which, without personal feeling either way.
and i'm going to do my job.
kat, , hot dog, you're up first.
pre-flight briefing in 20 minutes.
: where the hell are you going, hot dog? stay on me.
hot dog: target acquired and destroyed.
not bad, hot dog, but you left your leader behind.
kat: looks like you're having a bad day, hot dog.
and the moral of this story is? never leave your leader.
thank you. that is correct.
you never want to be out here alone.
starbuck: okay, , take kat's wing.
hot dog, you're on me.
we'll try a little manoeuvre called thorch weave.
i'll be damned.
what's got into starbuck?
tigh: she actually sounds like a real instructor for a change.
tigh: she may actually make viper pilots out of some of those nuggets after all.
starbuck: holy crap, we've got incoming.
tigh: where the hell did they come from?
dradis.
multiple contacts.
gaeta: it's the cylons.
tigh: why didn't we see them coming?
launch the alert fighters.
attention!
set condition throughout the fleet.
galactica, send the calvary.
nuggets, punch it for home.
adama: where's the base ship?
gaeta: no base ships detected, sir.
gaeta: eight raiders, bearing 047 carom 118.
range 22,000.
they found us. it was only a matter of time.
galactica, starbuck.
where the hell are the alert fighters?
alert one: starbuck, alert one.
be there in two minutes.
the cylons are gaining!
all right, listen up, nuggets.
stay together and keep your throttles firewalled until you hit the deck.
starbuck: now, go.
adama: what's she doing?
tigh: starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
and get herself killed.
kat: hot dog, where are you going?
starbuck: hot dog, what are you doing?
hot dog: got one!
starbuck: hot dog! get out of here!
starbuck: hot dog, i told you to get your ass home!
hot dog: you said never to leave your leader.
starbuck: i also said never to disobey an order.
i'm hit! i got you, hot dog! we're going to make it through this.
break right.
now!  she'll make it.
i just lost all three mains.
it's all right, hot dog.
you did good.
we're gonna be okay, i promise you.
at least one of us will.
starbuck: that about does it.
i think there's only one left.
frack!
starbuck: he's right on my tail, but i got it covered.
starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out.
alert one: alert one, we spotted hot dog.
no id or visual on starbuck.
frack me!  .
previously on battlestar galactica.
congratulations, doctor.
you've just uncovered your very first cylon.
i'm not a cylon.
this isn't happening.
i've been here for months, by myself, on the run, one step ahead of the cylons.
you're going out there or i'm gonna blow your brains out right here, right now.
how did crashdown die? he gave his life in the finest tradition of the service.
you have my parole.
when i'm on duty i'll make no attempt to free her or sow insurrection among the crew.
and when i'm not on duty, i'll report directly back to this cell.
i have a few months to live.
and in that time, i will lead the people to salvation.
it is my sole purpose.
as it appears obvious that,,, the government cannot function under the current circumstances,,, i have decided to dissolve the quorum of twelve,  and as of this moment,,, i have declared martial law, tigh you're sweating.
it's hot in here.
how long have you known lt.
valerii was planning to assassinate commander adama?
i had no idea she was planning anything of the kind.
you were frakking her.
i ended that weeks ago on your orders.
you covered for her, you lied for her.
i admit i used bad judgment.
you protected her at every turn.
colonel, i had no idea she was a cylon.
i would like to exercise my article 21 rights at this time.
i'm sure you would.
i guess you haven't heard, cylons don't have rights.
cylon?
wait a minute-- you know what we do with cylons, chief?
i am not a cylon.
roslin came up with the execution method.
i'm galen tyrol.
she put a cylon out of the airlock.
my father was a priest.
my mother was an oracle.
i've served on battlestar since i was 18 years old.
the pegasus, columbia, atlantia, galactica--  don't talk to me like you're a soldier!
you are not a soldier!
the old man always had a soft spot for you.
let him decide what to do with you.
colonel, you gotta believe me.
i am not a cylon.
i'd never do anything to hurt adama.
i love the old man.
that's what your girlfriend said.
get him the hell out of here!
chief.
i thought you were on kobol.
don't you talk to me.
don't come near me.
don't touch me.
if you do i swear, i will kill you.
no sign of centurions on the perimeter.
i don't like it.
human toasters don't go anywhere alone.
think they're bait?
no. a pair of cylons don't just drive up here in broad daylight not after we hit that convoy last week.
frakking a.  all right, screw it.
pass the word for everybody to sight in.
i want to blow these cylons away before they ever knew what hit them.
good.
we got to figure out where the hell we are.
why? you don't know?
you're the navigator.
you were driving.
starbuck all right, we can head toward cobb's point.
there's an emergency airstrip there.
no, i've been.
i was thinking we could head southwest towards--  do you hear that?
drive through a lot of bad neighborhoods?
better safe than sorry.
i hear that.
we're sitting ducks down here!
you go, i'll cover.
why me? don't start.
fine!
ready?
yeah! go!  five of them, spread out between nine and one!
50 meters.
ready?
go! i didn't see any shiny silver out there.
i think we're dealing with the human variety.
hope so.
they're not as tough as mechanicals.
yeah.
they do bleed good, though.
you gotta like that.
helo let's get out of here.
come on.
they locked the chief up with boomer.
tigh thinks he's a cylon.
i know.
i'm going to see the colonel now.
i think he wants me to find a way to clear the chief or. or what?
throw him out the airlock like a piece of garbage?
if commander adama were in charge this would never happen.
yes, but he's not in charge, is he? but i've known the chief for years.
he's no toaster.
he was involved with lieutenant valerii, who most certainly is a toaster.
that word is racist.
i don't like it.
cally sure he's shown some bad judgment getting involved with her. but that doesn't mean he's a toaster.
you've got to help him.
say something, gaius.
tell me you won't have racial epithets used in your presence.
i'm very sorry.
i was going to tell the colonel there's nothing i can do.
the cylon detector i developed doesn't work.
clearly.
no.
you've got to help him.
your child's gonna be half toaster.
how does that make you feel? nothing could make me happier.
i just don't know what i'd possibly say.
excuse me.
cally he helped you. he didn't tell anyone what you did on kobol.
what you did to crashdown.
what i did to crashdown saved your life.
are you blackmailing me? help the chief, help yourself, doctor.
yes, doctor.
that's what you're best at, isn't it?
deck log.
what the hell's the matter with your cylon detector, doctor?
you gave the assassin a pass.
yes, but that was a beta test.
a preliminary.
clearly, i haven't perfected my methodology and she slipped through.
dualla fuel report.
tigh what the hell are you telling me here that we are back to square one?
that no one's results are definitive?
no, l-- that we have no way of knowing who are the cylons among us?
baltar i'm not saying that.
i'm saying since valerii's test-- since the assassin's test, i've developed a new set of protocols which should eliminate any errors, anomalies, that cropped up earlier.
if you let me test the chief's blood i might be able to tell once and for all-- no if.
i want a definitive answer, no more of your weasly techno-babble.
he's a cylon or he's not so get down there and do something right for a change.
i am the vice president.
legally speaking, if the president is incapacitated shouldn't i take over her duties?
legally speaking, i have declared martial law and that makes you nobody.
so, unless you want to join roslin in the brig i suggest you get to work.
it's good to see you, colonel.
aren't you getting tired of the continual humiliation?
the disrespect from mechanics and colonels alike?
what do you think?
maybe it's time to do something about it?
gaeta sir? what's this? the fleet captains are reporting protests among civilians demonstrations, petitions, even some civil disobedience all over the declaration of martial law.
sir, there's more.
the tauranian refining vessel has stopped refining tylium.
they say if they don't have a voice in the government-- what?
their captain says they'll send fuel once a civilian government has been restored and, three other ships are also refusing to re-supply galactica,,, until the president's reinstated.
and i got a note from combat, warning about problems with tylium re-supply so watch your fuel burn until further notice.
questions? when you coming back to the card game? i'm afraid when i'm off duty, i'll be enjoying the intimate surroundings of the brig untilwell, until further notice.
come on back.
we miss you, captain.
we could bring the game to you.
somehow i doubt col.
tigh would approve.
there's one going on tomorrow night!
hey, all right.
all right.
hey, knock it off!
morning, sir.
sergeant.
shall we?  morning, sir.
morning, dee.
fancy meeting you here.
i was just on my way, sir.
hey, guys.
how's it going, dee? good, thanks.
how's my father today?
commander adama's the same, captain.
he's sedated.
resting comfortably since the surgery.
trouble brewing in the fleet, though.
oh, i'm shocked.
what kind of trouble?
martial law isn't going down too well.
protests, demonstrations some ships are even refusing to re-supply galactica, and this is the honeymoon period.
what's a dictator to do?  yeah, i wish.
i wish you were in command, sir.
dee.
he's hitting the bottle.
a lot.
thank you for the company, petty officer dualla.
you're welcome, sir.
you okay, baby?
no, i'm not okay.
my head feels like it's gonna roll off my shoulders.
what are you working on?
i'm trying to figure out how to solve our re-supply problem now that half the fleet has gone out on strike.
are you serious?
yes, i'm serious.
i should probably call a summit.
sit down with all the ship captains and explain the situation and tell them why i had to declare martial law.
screw them.
like you have to explain yourself to them. it wouldn't hurt.
might cool things down a little.
what?
nothing.
no, no, no, it's.
you're the boss.
far be it for me to tell you how to do your job.
i know that's one of your issues.
just say it.
i don't know, it just feels kind of touchy-feely.
you know, let's all sit down and talk about how we feel about martial law.
bill would never do that.
but you gotta do what you gotta do i mean, bill may never get on his feet again.
honey.
honey, you handle this the way you want.
they'll respect that eventually.
this is the xo.
mr.
gaeta, send the following to all ships captains.
message begins: re-supply operations of this ship are not, repeat, not optional.
all ships to recommence scheduled supply runs immediately.
failure to comply will result in stern measures.
message ends.
you happy now? starbuck i'll flank!
i'll draw fire!   no, no.
hi.
we're not cylons.
right.
you're human.
you have a soul.
you swim in the stream.
we heard it all before.
hey, colonial fleet.
notice the uniforms?
yeah, right.
we've seen cylons in uniform before.
we're human.
yeah, right.
starbuck everyone on caprica is dead.
you're not.
i just got here.
i want to hear some names.
i'm anders.
samuel t. anders?
yeah, that's right.
that's jo-man, rally, ten point, sue-shaun, crip-key, morris fink.
kara, these are the caprica buccaneers.
i don't think so.
give me a ball, little girl.
i'll shove it up your ass.
please.
try.
okay, since we're all getting along so well can people stop pointing their guns at us? how does a professional pyramid team survive a nuclear holocaust?
we were in the mountains when the cylons attacked.
high altitude training.
we've been on the run ever since.
doing what?
raiding military stores for ammo, anti-radiation meds and plugging toasters whenever they show up.
same as us.
okay.
how many foul breaks did you have in the play-off against aerilon?
you're kidding, right?
you either have the answer or you have a bullet.
three.
wrong.
four.
three.
last one was called back on instant replay.
helo he's right, starbuck.
i lost 20 cubits on that game.
fine, for now.
on three.
one.
two.
three.
you know you guys suck, right?
you can't shoot, you can't pass, and you sure as hell can't take a point.
everyone's a critic.
here's your medication, madam president.
and a little something from the galley.
thank you, cpl.
venner.
chamalla and licorice.
would you like some? i hate licorice.
me, too.
it's interesting he still calls you, madam president.
you still have a lot of supporters out there.
something ugly is coming.
i can feel it.
sir, the refinery captain's still not cooperating.
and now seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies, food, medicine, even coffee.
coffee?
this is getting ridiculous.
frak this.
it's time to get their attention.
i'm sending in the marines.
i want a raptor and an armed marine boarding party for every ship refusing the re-supply order.
sir, we're stretched pretty thin on manpower.
i'm not sure we have enough marine non-coms to command that many boarding parties.
pull pilots and deck officers to command the boarding parties if you have to.
tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies.
whatever it takes.
make it happen, lieutenant.
yes, sir.
people, step back.
all right.
we're just here for the supplies!
stay out of our way and no one gets hurt!
palladino for the last time!
step back, all right!
get back!
cease fire!  tigh four civilian dead.
how the frak could this have happened?
what did you expect, genius?
you put a pilot in charge of crowd control.
palladino!
did you give the order to shoot on that crowd?
no, sir. of course not. the crowd surrounded us.
were they armed?
no, sir, but you had to be there.
they were yelling and  at us and then it got violent.
they started throwing things, canisters coffee, i think.
coffee?
you shot people for throwing coffee? the crowd was out of control, they were pressing in on us.
my men were getting hurt.
somebody took a shot i don't know who it was.
then all hell broke loose.
if ever we needed you, bill, it's right now.
troops shooting unarmed civilians.
this is a travesty.
he has truly stepped over the line.
it'll cause an  in the fleet.
the press will have a field day. the ships will begin to splinter.
the cylons will be able to eliminate us a few ships at a time.
i've got to get out of here now.
corporal.
i'm right with you.
i'm so glad you said that.
i wanna take billy and elosha with me. of course you do.
i've worked out a way of getting us in the hangar deck and i can get us a raptor.
but we're still gonna need clearance to get off the ship.
i know how to get that.
you do? mmm-hmm.
the question is, where do we go once we get off this ship?
we'll have to find some place to hide in the fleet while we rally support among the people.
apollo i've got an idea about that.
you're not gonna like it.
i'm not cut out for this.
i never was.
don't talk like that, saul.
this is your moment.
me and bill, side by side, that was the deal.
it was never supposed to be me alone.
well, like it or not, you're in command.
so you better deal with it.
i don't want to deal with it.
i do not want a command, don't you get it?
jeez, why do listen to you? what are you talking.
i never told you to send troops out to that ship.
no, no.
you didn't tell me to send troops anywhere.
you just manipulate.
you always do. you put the knife in and you twist it.
oh, right.
you're gonna blame me for your own inadequacies?
i'm not blaming you, ellen.
you are so frakking passive that if i didn't push you well, forget it.
you'd never get your head out of that frakking bottle and do anything!
i'm warning you, i'm telling-- get your.
oh, yeah.
i love you so much.
shut up, ellen.
i guess you really must hate me.
i don't know if it makes any difference right now but i'm really sorry you got pulled into this.
you know, what we had-- was nothing.
nothing.
you're a machine.
i'm not.
well, whatever i am, i know how i felt.
software doesn't have feelings.
baltar open cell.
i never meant to hurt you.
i'd like some privacy, please.
i'll be fine, thank you. and how are we this evening?
what do you want?
i'm here to determine whether you're a cylon or not.
your arm, please.
his test doesn't work too well.
i mean, he gave me the green light.
the test works just fine.
chief?
chief?
baltar i lied to you, sharon.
i covered up your true nature from the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.
what did you do to him?
he's not breathing!
no, he's dying right now, sharon.
i can save him, if you tell me how many cylons there are left in the fleet.
i don't know, but i'm not getting a pulse!
yes, you do.
now, buried, deep down in that thing you call a subconscious, you know.
how many?
i don't know! he doesn't have time for this, sharon.
his organs are shutting down. in 10 seconds time, he'll experience complete brain stem death.
now, how many?
do you love him, sharon?
only you can save him.
ten, nine.
do you love him?
do you love him, sharon?
eight!
there are eight!
all right, let's get these weapons unloaded!
let's go! we raided an armory earlier today, about 18 klicks north.
brought home a lot of toys.
what is this place?
delphi union high school.
toasters don't patrol this area.
it's a good place to get some shut-eye, a bite to eat.
how many people you have here?
we had almost a 100 before the toasters ambushed us last week.
let's go! more pyramid teams?
no.
just us c-bucs.
the rest are survivalists, hikers, mostly.
how's your stock of anti-radiation meds?
anders we raided a couple of hospitals down in pilgrim bay.
i figure we've got enough for about three months.
let's get you some bunk space.
come on.
fifty-three, huh? not exactly an army.
a hell of a lot better than the two of us if we're going to assault an airbase steal a heavy raider and get the frak off this planet.
i'll just be a moment.
doctor i need your help.
but it's illegal, dangerous, and in violation of your oath as an officer.
you're a lousy salesman.
corporal.
cpl.
venner.
i just want to tell you how much the president appreciates all the little things you do for her.
hey, anything i can do to make things easier for her.
great.
she has a special request.
if i could just get your signature, sir.
why are we closing down causeway b? integrity testing, sir. it got chewed up pretty bad when the toasters boarded us and we've been getting some pressure drops in there.
tell them to get it fixed.
sorry.
lieutenant.
things are pretty frakked up these days.
things are pretty frakked up most days.
if people are upset they should go through proper channels, so.
i'm not sure i understand what you-- i was running some maintenance checks and detected a series of scrambled calls going out over the past few hours.
you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
no, sir.
off-log calls are against regs.
that's right.
i'm sure you won't approve.
but i guess that's nothing new.
i just want you to know that this.
this isn't about you and me.
goodbye, dad.
you gonna help out here or what?
they're putting the chief in there, you know.
i don't care if they put a giant parakeet in here.
the colonel says we build a cell, we build a cell.
this isn't right.
he's one of us.
no.
he's one of them. he always was. we just never saw it.
no, he's innocent.
she tricked him.
such loyalty.
were you frakking him, too?  you want to get pissed at someone, you get pissed at boomer.
she's the one who put the chief in this cell here, not us.
a truce?
evening, sir.
evening, dee.
fancy meeting you here.
everything set? roger that.
sorry, captain.
can't chit-chat today.
captain.
i'm having trouble with the ordinance tracking on my raptor, sir.
i can't get it to cycle.
oh, change of plans, boys.
instead of getting some rack time i'm gonna take a minute to do the lieutenant's job for her.
man yes, sir.
after you.
thank you. okay, make it look good, but not too good.
hold it!
private, do you know who i am? good.
you and have something in common.
we each took an oath to protect and defend the articles of colonization.
those articles are under attack as is our entire democratic way of life.
now, my duty won't let me stand here and allow that to happen.
so i intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
damn it.
they should be here by now.
you can either stand aside or you can shoot me.
you'll have to decide where your duty lies.
madam president.
madam president, this way.
oh, billy.
madam president i'm not getting on that ship with you.
what?
i understand what you're trying to do.
but it's gonna divide the fleet.
at the very best, it'll create an insurgency against adama and at the worst, a civil war.
taking part in that is a line that i won't cross.
apollo we do not have a lot of time.
i wish you well.
dustoff two-seven, checkers green ready for launch on medical mission.
request clearance.
good to see you.
you okay? i think so.
my feet barely touched the ground getting here.
i know what you mean.
man  dustoff two-seven, standard port three departure approved, cleared for launch, standard port three, wilco.
sir, cpl.
venner reports the former president's missing.
missing?
two men down.
cell's empty.
damn it.
alert security.
set condition two.
no one on or off the ship.
attention.
set condition two throughout the ship.
repeat.
set condition two throughout the ship.
sir, flight log records a raptor departed ship two minutes ago with doc cottle on a medical emergency.
medical?
confirm that.
dradis has their transponder bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3.
range 2-7.
get the cap on the horn and have them intercept.
and get captain adama out of the brig.
sir, doctor cottle is still onboard.
he says he was forced to request the raptor at gunpoint by apollo.
son-of-a-bitch.
dee, put me through to that raptor.
gaeta cap has visual on the target.
turn that ship around, apollo, or i'll order the cap to shoot you down.
apollo we're not turning back, i'll do it.
and don't think i won't just because you're the old man's son.
then do what you have to do, galactica, apollo out.
fire across their bow.
hotdog, galactica, fire across their bow.
acknowledge.
wilco, galactica.
hotdog reports they're not turning around, sir.
where are they now?
dradis shows them approaching cloud nine.
gaeta sir, if they dock, we may lose them.
cloud nine is one of the busiest transport hubs in the fleet.
shuttles are coming and going constantly.
if they board one and take off, it'll be before we can shut down air traffic.
galactica, hotdog, request instructions, galactica, hotdog, i need further instructions, do i fire or not?
dee, tell hotdog to hold his fire.
repeat, weapons hold.
do not fire.
hotdog, galactica, weapons hold.
repeat, do not fire.
they couldn't have done it on their own.
anybody notice off-log calls?
scrambled communications?
no, sir.
nothing.
well, we're home free for now.
zarek good to see you, madam president.
captain apollo what is mr.
zarek doing here?
once tigh gets over his initial shock, he'll send troops out to search for us.
if we're going to make it we have to keep on the move.
i figured mr.
zarek here is the only one in the fleet with enough shady friends around who could possibly hide us.
i love the way he puts that.
well, mr.
zarek.
it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
call me tom. a shuttle's waiting, ma'am.
we have to hurry.
wow, is that the best you can do?
nice to know installing a regulation pyramid court was one of the priorities of the resistance.
well, there are some things one cannot live without.
let's go.
anders are you kidding me? i'd wipe the court with you.
we'll see about that.
i was up for the pros.
bum knee took me out of contention.
i see. is that gonna be your excuse when i kick your ass? my poor knee hurts.
at least i have an excuse.
i can't imagine what yours is gonna be.
nice shot.
thanks.
thanks, doc.
i appreciate it.
don't thank me. thank her. tyrol why? what did she have to do with it?
baltar everything.
nothing.
love is a strange and wonderful thing, chief.
you'd be happy you experienced it at all.
even if it was with a machine.
tyrol what're they going to do to her? they're setting up a new holding facility.
there will be tests, mental, physical.
like she's.
like she's some kind of lab rat? that's the idea.
this is just great.
bill adama's little baby boy pulls the wool over your eyes and you let him get away scot free.
you're a stock.
you didn't want this command.
well, don't worry about it.
you won't have it for much longer.
all because when push came to shove, you got shoved.
it was his son.
adama saul.
what's happening on my ship?
wait in the corridor.
ellen, can i speak to my xo? of course.
slow.
what's happened?
i've frakked things up and good.
how? i made some bad calls.
i've done that.
not like these.
you gonna pour us one of those or what?
yeah.
i never had much use for people who second-guessed my decisions especially if they've never held a command.
they don't understand the pressure.
you make a call that affects the lives of thousands and you have no one to turn to for backup.
tigh you make it look easy.
you know that's a lie now.
a lot of pieces to pick up.
then we'll pick them up together.
where's my son? man bitch!
woman traitor!
no, no, no, no.
i love you, chief.
twelve cylon models seven are known four live in secre one will be revealed previously,on battlestar galactica.
you'll be safe here,gaius.
please,god,don't let this child die.
god answered your prayers, you have to see.
what?
look at him.
and no trace of a fever.
it's a miracle.
tory,tory,tory.
fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
you have an abundance of feeling.
i suppose i could be a cylon.
cylons can feel.
you believe that?
yeah,i do actually.
i want to explain.
she sought us out.
you know what has to be done here.
now,it would be better for her sake if it was you.
let's say cally does find out.
what do we do then?
the last thing we need is for your cylon-hating wife to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs running around this ship.
and that her husband is one of them.
ll stay the frak away from me! i heard you.
you're cylons.
a bunch of frakking skinjobs.
i couldn't keep you safe from harm,my love, but i kept you in my heart.
you were the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins, the light in my eye,and now that breath is gone.
that blood and the light are gone.
i am left,a voice.
and the lords of kobol,as many and as varied as mortal men, must bend down and lean low to hear that voice and hear my lament.
with all our thoughts and love, calandra henderson tyrol, we send your spirit into the universe.
so say we all.
so say we all.
i liked that service.
it's not for me,i'll tell you that.
i know,but i want you to know what i like. it was lovely.
thank you. why do they have to do these things at dawn? it's all right.
they do because they have to.
i'm sorry.
let me know if you need anything.
thank you. sorry about your loss.
sorry,chief.
what the frak was that?
get us all killed.
chief.
i'm--i'm so sorry.
what's it up to today?
same as-- slee,pacing.
don't know how it doesn't go nuts.
probably turns its brain off.
frakkin' toaster.
yeah.
colonel.
your request to see the child, hera agathon,has been denied.
and you felt the need to come all the way down here in person to tell me that again?
you think i want to come down here?
we're done.
i think we're not.
you come every day.
but you never ask questions anymore. is there something that you want from me? is there something that you need?
stay back.
see you tomorrow,colonel.
door!
what was that at the service this morning?
why don't you get on the wireless and tell the fleet about us? are you going to deal with that kid? probably needs to be changed.
all right.
you think cally killed herself because of you,don't you? she thought we were having an affair.
but we weren't.
i don't even know what i am anymore.
i don't know which of my memories are real.
i don't know that i've had one action in my life that isn't programmed.
galen,you're perfect.
you don't need guilt.
we were made to be perfect.
what is that?
more of baltar's crap?
so.
you just live without guilt?
just shut it down.
no,that wasn't the deal.
colonel,you said it yourself.
be the man you want to be till the day you die.
we're still the same people,aren't we? of course,we are.
you shut up.
that is not the same as human.
like we're stronger,right?
chief,what you're feeling is what a man feels when this happens.
it's normal,and it's human.
and it's not gonna end anytime soon.
it'll be there every day.
you'll see her every day.
you'll see her. be a man,chief.
feel what you gotta feel.
but don't risk us.
come on,tory.
just think about it.
think about what we are.
what we can do.
proudly presents sync: rocket in search of a home called earth battlestar galactica season episode dear gods,what.
gods?
thought there was only one.
what are you doing?
pulling one hair from your head at a time.
it's intense,isn't it?
yeah. it happens at the same time as a pleasurable touch.
frak! signals get crossed,don't they?
yeah.
it's hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.
yeah.
okay,listen,i think that you're very strong,aren't you? you really.
i think i preferred it when you cried.
if you assume that god forgives you,then it's gone,right?
erased?
forgiveness.
you must consecrate the sin.
make it benign.
oh,yeah.
bad becomes good.
oh,yes,it does.
pain becomes pleasure.
and doesn't that mean, if you really become one with god, you can never do wrong?
noll,,um,not really,because that wou.
that would more than imply that we're all perfect.
perfect?
yeah.
perfect just as we are.
no,no,no!no! go on,go,get out!
where is gaius baltar? he isn't here.
you,on your feet.
find him.
where is he? i don't know.
security alert.

go!go!go! we're coming back gaius baltar.
frak! finishing up,chief?
yeah,just give me one more relay.
i think it's a boy.
here you go,chief.
nice to be small,huh?
chief,we ready to go? i gotta get out of here.
yeah.
go ahead.

where's the admiral?
where is he? and what are you doing,taking notes, standing here,mr.officious?
you should be out there,right now, trying to find the people,whoever they are!
whatever you say,sir.
you can read the old text,can't you,gaius?
sons of ar-is?
ares.sons of ares.
they're the people who committed this attack.
obviously,a fundamentalist splinter group.
although,all they're doing is trying to protect the old gods.
old gods die hard.
even among your people.
i've seen you here before.
your name is.
don't tell me,um,begins with m. lilly.
lilly.
what's in your hand,lilly?
asklepius.
the god of healing.
i know you'll heal our people.
but i thought.
the old gods are fighting back.
those capacitors are still hot.
watch yourself,chief.
take my glove.
frak me.
my fault,didn't get swapped out.
yeah,we could have died.
was that in your pocket?
we don't have to do this.
you're right,we're okay.
it's okay.
is it?
skulls,is it?
galen.
i don't need to be patted on the head.
you can tell me i frakked up.
nobody got hurt,ok?
forget it.
you're only human.
no! don't say that!
tell me i frakked up! say it!
tell me i frakked up! any one of you.
cowards!
chief,uh,i can handle this.
why don't you take a little down time?
get out of the raptor,figurski.
people have room in their hearts for one great belief, you or the old gods.
which one will it be?
why can't i just be a man?
do i really need to take on the gods single-handed?
oh,but imagine the kind of man you'll be when you do.
surely such a man must be magnificent, larger-than-life,godlike himself.
what are you talking about?
it's not about that at all.
it's about this.
stop!
stop.
this is unacceptable.
we have been targeted because of what we believe by those who answer to faceless gods that bear no relevance in our world.
they want us to be afraid.
and i'm tired of being afraid.
the time has come to make a stand.
and that time is now.
gaius,what-- what are you doing?
where are you going?
gaius?
we ****** these stupid old gods!
sir,we're having a service.
are you?
but whom are you serving?
i have to ask you to leave.
do you?
would you be serving zeus?
apparently,king of the gods, who also happened to be, let me tell you,a serial rapist.
prone to giving birth out of his own forehead.
that's very likely,isn't it?
well,gods strike me down.
oh,what are you going to do? damn you.
you ignorant witch,telling the people lies and stories.
maybe you want me to pray to asklepius, who healed wounds with the blood of gorgons, or aphrodite or artemis or any other of this rubbish!
how awful!
out of the way,you hideous old witch.
that's the kind of rubbish that you made! i will not be destroyed at this level!
am i that late?
no,this wasn't a treatment.
it was just a blood test.
you brought a new book?
uh,yes.
something different this time.
it's a classic.
my favorite.
searider falcon,i haven't read it in years.
i don't remember how it ends.
i don't either.i
never read the ending.
you're kidding.it's
your favorite.
i like it so much,i don't want it to be over.
so i'm saving it.
maybe i should do that.
that's a bad idea.maybe
not.
let me do that for you.
okay,thanks.
baltar's back at home in the brig again.
desecration of a temple.
it's his revenge for what happened to him this morning.
it was brutal.
i have my personnel trying to track down anything on the sons of ares.
but nobody's talking.
the thing is that baltar knows that there are religious hardliners in dogsville, but he continues to provoke.
i just can't have a religious war in this fleet.
oh,please,no.
then the whole damn thing will become our frakkin' responsibility,yours and mine.
seriously,bill,we have 30,000 people left and they're not happy unless they're kicking each other's teeth in.
this is what we've become?
no,it's him.
baltar has an uncanny way of stirring up all the crap.
i wonder if he'd be willing to stay in lockdown, indefinitely,for his own safety.
and make a martyr out of him?no
way.
those girly,groupie,sex whatever-they-are, they already think he's a god.
so we kick him off of the galactica.
no,i want him close.
i'm going to the brig.
you want to see him?
i want him to see me.
oh,we didn't even make it to tomorrow,did we? you asked what i want.
i want to know how it feels to have killed billions of human beings, to have all that blood on your hands.
think it through.
because that's what i want.
i feel it.
do you really think that i couldn't?
do you?
or do you turn it off? is there a switch in your head that you turn off?
you talk like we're different, but you know we're not.
weapons.
working late,or up early,chief?
you act like you think i'm made of switches and relays.
look.
veins,not wires.
we're the same.
do you see we're the same?
then tell me.
tell you what? how you live with what you've done.
saul,are you asking for absolution?
forgiveness?
i can give you that.
stand down.
step outside.
just tell me what the trouble is.
no.you have nothing to offer me.
we're not the same.
were you asleep?
what is it this time?
here to strip-search me? or could it possibly be that your presence here means that the president has been made aware of my situation.
it's being looked into. is it really?
aggressively.
now here's the thing.
i want you to look at me,gaius.
just look at me. this is a wig.
i'm dying.
now,if you look in my eyes.
go ahead,look.
you can probably see it.
i'm very sorry.
no,no,no,no,i don't want your pity.
i'm still doing my job. in fact,i'm gonna aggressively pursue the men that attacked you.
and i'm going to limit the size of public assemblies to protect your people,but.
i'm going to be slip away from this life very soon.
and i've gotten kind of curious as to what that's going to be like, and so,i did some research.
and there are some people who say that when people are getting closer to their death, they just don't care as much about rules and laws and conventional morality.
are you threatening me? no,no,i'm just saying have a quiet life.
and i'll die a quiet little death.
and everyone will be happy.
it's just that i'm not in the mood any longer to indulge you.
and that's.
all.
and you are being released,so.
stay safe.
hey,chief.
we all miss her,chief.
i understand if you need some time off.
or even if you might need more shifts to keep yourself busy.
no one knows how they're going to react to loss like this, or what they're gonna need.
i don't need special treatment.
i guess she just couldn't take it,huh?
being married to a cylon?
being the mother of a half-breed abomination?
***** thank you. she was a good woman.
if you really believe that, you wouldn't have threatened to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.
it's okay,though.
i thought about doing it many times myself.
believe me.
chief,it's how many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with?
got stuck with the best of limited options?
and why? because the ones we really wanted, the really loved,were dead and dying, or turned out to be cylons and they didn't know it.
if boomer had.
listen.
if i had known.
listen,let's.
no.
let's go.
no,no.
i didn't know.
let's go home i didn't know.
so i buried my head in the sand and i took it and i settled!
i settled for that shriek, those dull vacant eyes, the boiled cabbage stench of her. and why?because this is my life! this is the life i picked.
and it's fine,but you know what?it's not.
i didn't pick this life.
this is not my frakkin' life.
what the hell's gotten into you?
don't do this.
don't do this to her memory.
you know what?
i'm sorry if i'm not gonna do this the way you want me to, or the way you might.
but i will not make an angel out of someone who wasn't an angel.
but i can see you have.
and now you've come down here to be in my club, but you're not in my club.
you don't know what frakkin' club i'm in 'cause you never asked the right questions.
chief,let's get out of here.
no. why don't you go? take care of your precious ship.
stop it.
stop all of this.
'cause if you don't,i'm going to have to act on it.
now shut up.
great!
do it!
please!
for the love of gods,please demote me.
get me off your frakkin' ship! specialist tyrol,i want you off my hangar deck before you endanger another pilot.
you're to report to petty officer bassom tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment.
do you understand? of course you have authority over emergency measures, but you bulldozed this through after the session was closed.
yes **** it's a crowd control measure.
i also authorized the repair of a cargo elevat or do you want to talk about that too? crowd control?
looks to me like it was pretty well designed purely to stop gaius baltar's organization.
you mean his cult?
well his cult was attacked.
and from what i'm hearing around the fleet, it was pretty brutal.
it was brutal.
exactly.
and this measure is designed explicitly to protect those people.
if they aren't gathering en masse, they aren't provokreg sentment.
but limits his group,while permitting more mainstream worship.
wherever gaius baltar is,violence happens.
and if he doesn't cause it,he draws it.
my job,mr.adama,is
and always will be, to keep the people safe.
madame president, i have to wonder tifhis resolution couldn't be used against other offshoot religious groups.
absolutely not.
gaius baltar is a special case.
you know that.
and we're making him a special case.
and how are we doing that?
we're fueling his argument.
i mean,after all,is he preaching violence?
immoral acts?
i don't know.
i haven't been to one of his what are they called?services?
it's not that far from what some of our own mithras followers believe.
we have mithrasaries among the gemenese.
can this order be applied to them? clear your heads.
we are talking about gaius baltar.
everyone in this room experienced tragedy at new caprica.
have we forgotten?
will you open this order to a full quorum vote?
no.
we can override,madam president.
i cannot let this stand.
you can override,and you cannot let this stand,mr.adama?
then you open it up to a vote.
and if you strike this down, you can all go back to your constituents and you can tell them what you've done, and we,the people, will have triumphed.
but think about what it's gonna cost you.
because every single one of you remembers what it was like when gaius baltar had political power.
and you should be terrified to think about what this man will do with blind religious devotion.
so go ahead.
vote.
should i get used to waking up to this face?
you're traveling light.
an informal chat.
just you and me.
and the man watching through the cameras.
you haven't answered my question.
you want to know how i work? if i can turn off pain? can you?
i want the pain.
it's how i learn.
i was instrumental in the destruction of humanity.
but at the same time,i learned because.
because i fell in love.
with a human man.
and he was mortal.
and fallible.
and he had this incredible pride in himself. he thought he knew everything there was to know.
and i loved him with my whole heart.
and then one day,i realized i wouldn't have him forever.
i understood what i'd done.
how i betrayed him and humanity.
and that pain taught me to understand death.
baltar could die.
and i loved him.
no.
baltar's heart was ephemeral.
no.
baltar's body was fragile in my hands.
no,we are not gonna talk about the fragile body of gaius frakkin' baltar!
door!
door!
dismissed.
clear out,out!
frak,what's he gonna do to her? i can tell you how to turn it off.
how? pain is how i learn from the guilt.
there's wisdom there.
clarity.
you know yourself there.
pain.
our minds were designed based on your minds.
we learn things about how you work that you've never known.
when you're in pain,that's when you learn who you really are.
that's when you focus, sharp as the point of a knife.
i can give you that clarity again.
i'm sorry,sir,i'm not supposed to let you enter.
what's going on?what are you doing?
there are 12 people inside already.
you can count,can you? yes,sir,you can't enter without breaking emergency provision 170.
people,let me out.
if i leave,then he can come in.
yes,if she leaves, then i can come in.
we're asking everyone to stay inside for safety reasons.
oh,this is absurd.
you're just counting heads.
i have my orders.
yeah,but i live here,okay?
i live here,and so do some of these women.
where are we supposed to go? this is your moment,gaius.
step forward.make a stand.
uh,i don't want to be a hero.
i just want to go to bed.
go to sleep.
look at me. i promise you.
step forward,and you will not be hurt.
promise me? yes, you can lie down inside.go
in.
stop,sir.
gaius!
get your frakkin' hands off me, you frakkin' freak machine!
can you feel it,saul?
can you feel the clarity of it?
stay down or clear this area,sir!
you have to do this.
the gain will outweigh the cost.
i want to stay down.
i really want to stay down.
no,you don't.
stay down,please,sir!
wait,wait,stop!
lieutenant.
stand down.
the quorum has just met in an emergency session.
full right of assembly has been restored.
you can,uh,you can go back into your home.
no one will stop you.
oh,gaies.
thank you i don't do these things for you.
you do them because your god compels you.
okay,okay.
lee has no idea.
he really has no idea.
have you heard anything i said?
there are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.
well,that'pra oblem,of course.
he's doing what he thinks is right.
well,yeah,he's lee.
thing is,it probably is the right thing,but.
sometimes the right thing is a luxury.
and it can have profoundly dangerous consequences.
and yet it's almost as if he doesn't want that to be true.
okay,i gotta stop this.
i'm not supposed to get upset during treatment.
will you read the next chapter?
i must warn you that i'm getting into the part that i haven't read yet.
oh dear.
are you going to be able to continue?
chapter 7: the raft was not as seaworthy as i had hoped.
the waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it.
i wasn't afraid to die.
i was afraid of the emptiness that i felt inside.
i couldn't feel anything.
that's what scared me. it came into my thoughts.
it filled them.
it felt good.
more.
no.
keep going.
no,i made a mistake.
this isn't what you need.
i'm not a priest.
i've never even been a particularly good man.
i have,in fact,been a profoundly selfish man.
but that doesn't matter,you see.
something in the universe loves me.
something in the universe loves the entity that is me.
i will choose to call this something god. a singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being.
if you look inside yourself, you will find this spark too.
you will.
but you have to look.
deep.
love your faults.
embrace them.
if god embraces them, then how can they be faults?
love yourself.
you have to love yourself.
if we don't love ourselves, how can we love others?
and when we know what we are, then we can find the truth out about others.
see what they are.
the truth about them.
and you know what the truth is, the truth about them.
about you.
about me.
do you? the truth is we are all perfect, just as we are.
god only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you. he loves you because you are perfect.
you are perfect just as you are.
battlestar galactica 4x04 escape velocity.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
zak failed basic flight.
and i should have flunked him, but i didn't.
the bottom line is that i killed him.
walk out of this cabin while you still can.
helo: i don't get it.
how does a military coded signal end up coming from in here?
helo: food.
gaeta: it's the cylons.
starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out.
tigh: starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
and get herself killed.
boomer: galactica.
hot dog's aboard.
helo: yeah, so is his lunch.
take it easy, hot dog.
you're not the first to lose it in combat.
helo: you won't be the last.
no sign of starbuck.
he says she was hit but still in the fight when he lost track of her.
dualla: roger that.
search and rescue ops are underway for starbuck.
bring hot dog in. the old man wants to talk to him.
adama: this is where you found him?
yes, sir, he drifted quite a ways from the fight.
adama: was she manoeuvring?
hot dog: i think so.
yes.
yes, sir.
so she survived the initial hits.
she could still be alive.
she is alive, lieutenant.
we're gonna find her.
boomer: yes, sir.
adama: get this man to sick bay.
apollo: yes, sir.
i think you earned those today.
the auxiliary rt switch sticks a little, sir, but she'll fly.
polish up the canopy.
i want it crystal clear.
yes, sir.
find her.
i will.
gaeta: still no joy from the search teams. in the last four hours we've combed everywhere in a 200 click sphere around starbuck's last known position.
no ship, no ejection seat, no debris.
so we're extending the radius another 50.
we need more pilots.
everybody who can fly is up, sir.
what about starbuck's course computations?
the variables of combat manoeuvring make them almost meaningless.
it's time to start guessing.
yes, sir.
since there's been no dradis contact in the area i would have to guess that her viper was captured by the gravity of a planetary body.
the only nearby gravity wells are the gas giant and this moon.
if the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg.
what about the moon? the spectroscope people call the atmosphere as co2, methane, some argon.
the clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.
gaeta: cold as hell down there, but she'd survive on the surface.
until her oxygen runs out.
when?
gaeta: forty-six hours and change, sir.
hell of a long time to stay in one place.
what if the cylons appear?
they won't, not for a while.
what makes you say that?
sending a patrol instead of the base ship tells me they didn't even know we were here.
so they're searching a lot of other places, places with potential supplies.
like staking out water holes in the desert.
if we sent eight fighters to search an entire star system for 60-odd ships, it would take us weeks assume they're better and faster.
it'll take them days.
a lot of assumptions you're making.
educated guess.
talk to me about searching the moon.
that's going to be slow going.
we can't see squat through those clouds.
send the ships below the cloud cover.
tell the pilots to take a hard look the old-fashioned way.
mark one eyeball, sir? mark one eyeball.
commander, call from colonial one.
adama.
commander adama, i don't wanna take much of your time.
i wanted to say how happy we all are you found one of your pilots. adama: thank you, madam president.
how is the search progressing for the other pilot?
nothing yet, but we've just begun.
roslin: i've spoken with the other captains in the fleet.
they've agreed to give over their ships at your disposal if it'll increase the odds of finding her.
adama: frack the odds.
we're going to find her.
excuse me.
thank you. tell them we could sure use the help.
i'll coordinate their efforts with your cic.
continued good luck.
adama: thank you. thank you.  so it looks like we're going to be staying here for a while.
you all right?
yeah, i'm fine, it's just a how long you think it will be before the cylons wonder what happened to their missing patrol, and send another one here to look for it?
you have attacked us hundreds of times.
we're still here.
i think you'll find that we are more than adequately protected.
might be a little tricky with the fleet scattered over half this system iooking for the lost pilot.
no.
6: how many days till the cylons return, gaius?
one?
no.
6: two? three at the most?
roslin: doctor?
your requisitions.
thank you. baltar: madam president, i don't mean to be impertinent, really, but do you honestly think this is wise?
you are compromising the security of the entire fleet while we search for one solitary pilot.
it is a risk, but those pilots put their lives on the line for us every day.
yes.
i was just saying that, to baltar: i'm not insensitive, that is what i'm saying.
baltar: i happen to know the missing pilot personally.
not as personally as you'd like.
guess you'll never find out if she's a real blonde.
it's all the more difficult for me.
on one hand i think of the pilot.
and on the other hand i think of the thousands of defenceless women and children.
i meant, throughout the fleet.
i am sure commander adama has considered all of this.
thank you, doctor.
yes, of course he has. of course he has.
thank you.    it's okay.
okay, get to higher ground.
then they see you.
then they rescue you.
apollo, galactica, we are being bounced around like beach balls down here.
apollo: visibility about two, best spectrum.
dualla: copy, apollo.
blue! blue flight, go vertical now!    anything?
no.
i don't think anyone's left out there.
must be someone.
we can't be the only two people left in the world.
good news is my leg's much better and we've got anti-radiation meds to last three months.
helo: i say we load up as much food as we can and boomer: move out.
try to find a raptor or a transport or something we can fly off caprica.
unless you can think of a reason to stay.
not really looking forward to going back out there.
helo: i've almost started to think of this place as helo: home.
boomer: home.
no, sleep a little longer.
who knows when we'll find clean sheets again.
i'm going to go topside and make some breakfast.
breakfast.
hey, is breakfast ready?
helo: get out of here!
go!  lords, it's kara thrace.
i'm running a little low on o2 and i could use a lucky break.
you know?
okay, just thought i'd mention it.
not bad shooting, if i do say so myself.
lords, i owe you one.
looks like i found my ride out of here.
if i can fix you up.
galactica, apollo.
bingo fuel.
dualla: roger, apollo.
return to base.
apollo: can't you tank me in orbit?
dualla: negative, apollo.
the tankers are refilling.
you'll be dry before they can launch.
adama: are these figures correct?
gaeta: yes, sir.
gaeta: atmospheric ops mean viper and raptor engines run continuously.
fuel's going to be a real problem if we keep it up.
adama: any report from the civilian ships?
tigh: nothing.
they're spread pretty far out.
we'll have a hell of a time trying to cover them if the cylons pop in.
we should consider pulling the civvies into a defensible formation.
no.
keep all the ships on the search.
we've left enough people behind.
i don't wanna leave starbuck behind.
committing the entire fleet to this i said no! we are going to find our missing pilot and we're going to bring her home.
we leave no one behind.
resume your duties.
helo: sharon?
helo: sharon, where are you?
damn it, sharon, where are you?
sharon!
frack me.
are you alive?
what the hell happened this time, captain?
i hit the roll thrusters to level off for set down but only the left one fired.
it's that crap you're flying into down there.
gums everything up.
get me another viper.
tyrol: love to, but this is 13 vipers that are down, plus your mark vii.
i'm out.
i've got a pilot down and i need another viper now.
i realise that, captain.
but you can push people a lot further than machines.
i'm the cag, you're the chief.
just make it happen.
commander, the clock has passed five hours, sir, for starbuck's o2 supply.
noted.
gaeta: here's the photo mosaic for the area we searched so far.
we've got to do better than this.
can't see far when you're hugging the ground.
you can't see anything from altitude.
not to mention the crap in the air that keeps screwing up our ships.
apollo: thirteen vipers down for repairs.
adama: we need more eyes.
tigh: where we going to get them?
apollo: pull the cap.
tigh: what?
redeploy the combat air patrol to the search.
bad idea.
the cap is the fleet's only defence.
if all vipers are fracking around on the moon when the cylons come calling, we're maggot meat.
then bring the fleet closer to the moon.
we can always scramble the vipers from the search to meet any attack.
bottom line: we can double the area we can search in the time we have left.
starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this.
nothing would make you happier, would it?
leave her behind.
get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate pilot that keeps challenging your authority.
you are way out of line.
i'm not the one confusing personal feelings with duty.
what the hell does that mean?
you are way too close to this because she's your friend.
gentlemen!
we have work to do.
captain.
get as many birds up in the air as you can and you find our girl.
you got it.
starbuck: oh, my gods.
you bite me, i'll bite you back.
starbuck: so i guess the only thing flying you is you.
this must be your brain.
i don't think you'll need it.
good thing that i brought one of my own.
even cockroaches have to breathe.
how the hell do you?
socinus: captain.
call for you, sir.
can someone finish this up for me? apollo: where is it?
socinus: that way.
apollo: yeah, apollo.
billy: hold for president roslin.
roslin: how're you holding up? better than my viper.
we're slap one together from pieces of the others.
roslin: i need your help.
did you know that your father just redeployed the combat air patrol?
yes, madam president. it was my idea.
your idea?
we need every viper we've got.
roslin: maybe i'm missing something about the tactics involved.
but isn't the fleet defenceless without the cap? apollo: only for a short time.
because after that, kara's oxygen will be gone and she'll be dead.
are you very close with lt.
thrace?
i'm close with all my pilots. and i assume the same is true for your father?
his pilots mean a lot to him.
to all of us.
we don't leave anyone behind.
but we have left people behind.
you know that.
not this time.
your ftl drive should be spun up and ready.
just make sure everyone is set to jump at the first sign of trouble.
with all due respect, captain there are times when it is necessary for the safety of the fleet to put not this time.
we just haven't exhausted all the options and the safety of the fleet has not been compromised.
i hope you find her.
thank you. blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir.
have them stay on the search.
send the tanker to them. is there a problem, mr.
gaeta?
it's just that trying to tank in that turbulence, sir, will be extremely hairy.
i suggest we wait until the clock has run down and then tank up on the way back to galactica.
did someone call them back to galactica?
i just assumed the search was over? it was hopeless?
that we should write starbuck off as dead? is that what you're telling me, mr.
gaeta?
no, sir.
then what are you trying to tell me, mr.
gaeta?
you have your orders.
yes, sir.
time is up.
she's out of o2. the clock is a guess.
adama: we don't know for a fact that starbuck is out of air.
her tank only holds so much oxygen.
she could have a reserve supply in her survival gear.
tigh: a reserve?
adama: yes.
what, she just happened to pack an extra bottle today?
it's possible.
we are putting people at risk.
we have pilots out there we are not quitting.
pushing themselves, their ships too hard, all for the sake of we are not quitting and you are relieved, colonel.
i stand relieved, sir.
come on, you're part biological, right?
which means you need oxygen, right?
so it's got to be here, somewhere.
commander, the president.
adama.
commander adama, i just wanted to say how very sorry i am about lt.
thrace.
please give my condolences to your son and to the rest of the crew.
excuse me, madam, but i think you've been misinformed.
how? we don't know if starbuck's dead.
roslin: i was told that her oxygen had run out a half an hour ago.
that's an estimate.
she may have a reserve supply.
we'll continue the search as long as there's a chance she may be alive.
roslin: and how long will that be? adama: until i say stop.
this is a military decision, madam president.
thank you for your concern.
starbuck: first on the list, seal you up figure out what controls what.
one of us needs a bath.
now you're going to teach me how to fly.
red flight reports an area of highlands here.
increased visibility out to 15  maybe.
it's the wrong side of the moon.
dualla: commander adama: almost impossible to we have a signal from colonial one's shuttle.
they request permission to land.
the president's on board.
why wasn't i notified the president was coming onboard?
there was no advance notice, sir.
gaeta: i didn't know she was coming.
adama: let's go.
adama: have col.
tigh meet her at the airlock.
adama: bring her to my quarters, please.
dualla: very well.
every flying machine has four basic controls: power, pitch, yaw, and roll.
where are yours?
safety tip number one: don't touch that.
are you going to order us to stop the search?
i came here to talk, not to give orders.
it may take an order.
why? col.
tigh, do i need to know something?
it's gone beyond military needs.
it's personal for the commander and lee.
because of lt.
thrace?
because of her, and because of zak adama.
roslin: the commander's dead son.
it's complicated.
take about three weeks to explain.
we've got about three minutes.
talk fast.
she's going to press.
i'm with you.
tigh: president roslin.
adama: madam president.
skip the formalities.
you both know why i'm here.
termination of a pilot's rescue mission is a military decision.
that's a bunch of crap.
this isn't military, it's personal.
neither of you can let go of kara thrace because she's your last link to zak.
you don't know anything about my brother.
don't even begin, captain.
you've lost perspective.
as have you.
under normal circumstances it would just be sad that you two can't come to terms with zak's death. in this situation you're putting your pilots at risk.
you're exposing the fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here.
we've been at risk of an attack since day one.
adama: the cylons won't be missing their patrol for at least one more day.
col.
tigh, how much a.
previously on battlestar galactica.
i have a few months to live.
and in that time, i will lead the people to salvation.
it is my sole purpose.
praise be to the gods.
here is our salvation.
laura roslin's actions in suborning mutiny and sedition among the military could not be tolerated.
therefore, cdr.
adama was left with no choice other than to remove her from office.
we've got to get out of here now.
i'm right with you.
i think these guys might really be human.
everyone on caprica's dead.
you're not.
i just got here.
not exactly an army.
a hell of a lot better than the two of us if we're gonna assault an airbase steal a heavy raider, and get the frak off this planet.
nice to know installing a regulation pyramid court was one of the priorities of the resistance.
nice shot.
thanks.
stand aside or you can shoot me.
i intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
the former president's missing.
missing?
two men down.
cell's empty.
damn it.
apollo well, we're home free for now.
glad to see you, madam president.
zarek here is the only one with enough shady friends around who can possibly hide us.
all traitor!
man cally shot boomer!
tyrol no, no.
no.
i love you, chief.
what's happening on my ship?
i frakked things up and good.
i made some bad calls.
a lot of pieces to pick up.
then we'll pick them up together.
go through.
you've been awake for an hour?
so what are you gonna do if you can't make it back to your ship?
i'm getting back.
well, i know we were able to take your sorry ass by surprise.
frak you.
nice.
but the truth is we really don't know what the hell we're doin'.
a lot of our tactics are stuff we just saw in the movies.
we could use some professional advice.
you want some advice?
you're on the losing end of this fight.
give it up before you all die.
head further up in the mountains above the ambient radiation, and just hole up.
and what?
wait to die? as soon as i get back to galactica, i'll send a rescue party.
yeah, right.
if i say i'm gonna do something, i do it.
you always such a bitch in the morning?
count on it.
my kind of woman.
hey.
we have a mission to accomplish.
so what?
mission.
fine.
whatever.
i'm sorry, okay?
i didn't mean to--  got you.
so weak.
so, so very weak.
lighten up a little bit.
it's only the end of the world.
sue-shaun, i want you to watch our perimeter, especially on the flank.
okay.
the cylons have a refueling airstrip just on the other side of that ridge.
there's a heavy raider makes a regular refueling stop every afternoon, like clockwork.
helo machines like routine.
yeah.
it's usually ed by less than three of the mechanical varieties.
we've left it alone up until now.
helo so what's the plan?
go through this gully, approach the airstrip from the south side sprinkle our men through the tree line wait for the cylons to land the raider hook up the refueling hoses.
once they hook up the tylium hoses we take out the s and blow their refueling station.
i thought you wanted the raider intact?
they build them tough.
believe me.
blowing the fuel will barely put a scratch on the hull but it might give us enough time to board the raider.
once i'm inside i'll blow the brain, and i'll start working on trying to get it--  man  stay back! over there!
man  open fire!   anders kara, take cover!
get back!
everybody fall back!
fall back!
kara, let's go!   adama!
adama!
adama!
thank you very much.
i'm glad to be back.
there are things we don't say often enough things like what we mean to one another.
all of you mean a lot to me.
i just want you to know that.
let's get back to work.
i feel strange.
like.
closer to the ground.
you should check in with the doctor.
mr.
gaeta?
where do we think they are now? the stolen raptor with capt.
adama and the former president.
the fugitives.
the fugitives docked at cloud last week.
we effectively lost them at that point due to the large volume of inter-fleet traffic going to and from cloud 9, by now, they could be holed up anywhere in the fleet.
i want them found.
she was dangerous enough as a symbol of resistance but now with lee hel.
i wanna search every ship in the fleet.
quarantine procedures.
isolate the ship out of the main body.
if it's clean, we keep it quarantined away from the rest of the fleet.
she can hide, but she can't run.
dee, start quarantine procedures.
start with cloud 9, roslin how much longer are we meant to stay hidden in this meat locker?
elosha i don't know.
i communicated your latest message to the quorum of twelve and they've decided that the question of openly supporting you needs more deliberation.
i need to make an appeal to the people.
make a strong enough argument and the astral queen will be the first ship in line.
like they knew anything but roll over and take orders from you.
one more bit of news i should convey.
zeus has returned to olympus.
adama's back in command.
my father?
he's back?
zarek word just came in over the wireless.
he is a tough old bird.
zarek what we really need is something heartfelt something human and personal that will galvanize the people.
like a son denouncing his father.
apollo my name is lee adama.
until recently, i was the commander of galactica's air group but when cdr. adama, my father decided to stage a military coup against the president i could no longer support him or his actions.
i love my father.
i respect him.
but in this he is wrong.
he must be opposed.
i call on all free-thinking people in the fleet.
i. i can't do this.
sorry, everyone.
i thought i could, but i can't.
i'm playing the religious card.
i know exactly what i have to do.
how does this thing work?
simon you're okay.
you're in an aid hospital.
they brought you in yesterday morning.
you got shot in the abdomen.
i'm simon.
can you tell me your name?
kara.
kara thrace.
simon you were in surgery for about two hours.
i removed the bullet.
i didn't think you were gonna make it there for a while.
take it easy.
i know that hurts.
who brought me in? simon this big guy named anders.
used to be a pro pyramid player, if you can believe that.
yeah, i know him.
where is he? he died.
on the table.
i thought he was only slightly wounded.
it turns out a piece of shrapnel had nicked his aorta.
massive internal bleeding.
i'm sorry.
we did everything we could do.
simon good morning.
i see you're sucking down fluids at a rapid pace.
that's good.
are you a cylon?
what do you think?
i think you didn't answer the question.
i am most definitely not a cylon. of course, i don't know what you'd expect me to say.
if i was a cylon, i certainly wouldn't admit it.
can i leave?
there's the door.
frakking doctors.
so i am a doctor, not a cylon? the jury's still out.
i would expect the cylons to have better digs than this, though.
where is this rattrap?
we're about 20  north of delphi.
used to be a mental institution.
it's not much, but it's one of the few places the cylons haven't found yet.
okay.
so, what, i'm supposed to believe there really is a resistance out there? shh.
don't tell anybody.
we're trying to keep that quiet.
time for your pain meds.
tyrol if i may speak on behalf of specialist cally?
she was distraught through the experience on kobol.
being on the surface, fighting the cylons it's shattering for all of us.
i don't believe she was in her right mind when she shot boomer.
did you love her, chief?
excuse me? boomer.
did you love her? i thought i did.
when you think you love somebody, you love them.
that's what love is: thoughts.
she was a cylon, a machine.
is that what boomer was? a machine? a thing?
that's what she turned out to be.
she was more than that to us.
she was more than that to me.
she was a vital, living person aboard my ship for almost two years.
she couldn't have been just a machine.
could you love a machine?
no, sir.
i guess i couldn't.
cally discharged a firearm without permission endangering the lives of her shipmates.
thirty days in the brig.
dismissed.
thank you, sir.
you'll see her again, chief.
excuse me? there are many copies.
you'll see her again.
how many patients do you have here?
am i being interrogated again?
i just think it's odd that i've been here for two days, and i haven't seen anybody else.
just you.
we have 223 patients at the moment two doctors, and five teachers masquerading as nurses.
i know a teacher masquerading as president.
what's that?
it's awfully quiet.
no , no moans, no doctor!
doctor!
please help me! it hurts.
most of our patients are succumbing to acute radiation poisoning.
symptoms include powerful fatigue and immediate nausea.
this is followed by several days of comparable well-being.
after that, cell death in the gastric and intestinal tissue causes massive diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and loss of water.
it's not pretty.
but it is quiet.
the biggest killer in this place is infection.
that's why we have you under quarantine.
we don't know what you brought in with you yet.
your test results will be back this afternoon.
okay, almost done.
i think there may be a cyst on one of your ovaries. is it serious?
no, it should be fine.
we'll keep an eye on it.
gotta keep that reproductive system in great shape.
that's your most valuable asset these days.
right.
i'm serious.
finding healthy, child-bearing women your age is a top priority for the resistance and you'll be happy to know that you are a very precious commodity to us.
i am not a commodity.
i'm a viper pilot.
you see any vipers around here?
i mean, you do realize that you're one of a handful of women left on this planet actually capable of having children, right?
i mean, that is your most valuable skill right now.
well, i don't want a child, so just drop it, okay?
well, no one's forcing you.
just take a moment and think about where you are and what's going on. the human race is on the verge of extinction.
and, to be quite frank with you, potential mothers are a lot more valuable right now than a whole squadron of viper pilots. i shouldn't have mentioned it.
i should've known you'd be sensitive.
a lot of women with your history forego bearing children of their own.
my history?
i saw the fractures on your x-rays.
a lot of old fractures from childhood.
it's interesting how you managed to break every finger on both hands.
every break in the exact same place, between the first and the second knuckle.
did someone break your fingers, kara?
get out.
children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
get out!
all right.
is she kidding with this? i know it's hard to believe, but that message has cropped up all over the fleet.
it's religious crap.
lt seems i have been chosen to help lead you to the promised land of earth.
will not question this choice.
will simply try to play my part in the plan.
therefore, at the appointed hour will give a signal to the fleet.
all those wishing to honor the gods and walk the path of destiny will follow me back to kobol.
lt is there that we will meet the gods' servant with the arrow of apollo.
we've got five raptors with marine fire-teams standing by to board the astral queen, no one's gonna follow her.
no one's gonna believe this crap.
no one's this stupid.
and anyone that is, that wants to make a suicide run to kobol please let them.
roslin how long till we jump?
two minutes.
any other ships declared themselves for us?
not yet.
no, that.
no, please, this isn't necessary.
give them your blessing.
oh, no.
it's not right.
it isn't who i am.
laura, this is your path the one the gods picked for you the one you picked for yourself.
sue-shaun!
helo anders, we must have been over this line 10 times already.
she must have taken a bullet.
she was right here by the vehicles.
she would have got up and crawled the frak out of here.
hey, we have to search the entire area again.
i told you we shouldn't have pulled back so fast.
i thought she was with us.
anders, we got ambushed, okay?
we all got separated.
there's nothing we could have done about it.
kara, of all people, would understand.
let's just find her.
wait a minute.
wait a minute.
boomer i know where starbuck is.
sharon?
where have you been? tracking you.
who is she? she's with us.
you're the father of my child, helo.
i'm not gonna lose you.
where is she? zarek we're ready.
send the signal and jump.
astral queen has jumped away.
now we'll see how many follow.
to sit around and wait for starbuck to show up with that stupid arrow?
two, three at the most.
good morning.
you look better.
what's this new scar?
you had to go back in last night while you were asleep.
some internal bleeding to tie up.
nothing to worry about.
everything's gonna be fine.
we're just about done with you, starbuck.
nice way of puttin' it.
just a couple more tests, and.
i almost said, we'll be sending you back home.
i guess we'll be sending you back into the fight.
that sounds good to me.
hey, i just woke up.
and now you're going back to sleep.
you're the doc.
simon pending lab-test results on sample ovaries complete removal will proceed tomorrow.
if lab tests are positive, then subject will be removed to processing facility for final disposition.
no. is that regret i hear in your voice, simon?
if it is, it certainly is none of your concern.
lords of kobol, please help me.
good morning.
are you sure you're feeling okay?
you know, something actually has been bothering me lately.
i never told you my call sign was starbuck.
you can't kill me.
just die!     sue-shaun.
sue-shaun, it's me, kara.
hold on, okay?
i'm gonna get you out of here.
no, no time.
cut the power.
that'll kill you.
can't live like this. the baby machines.
please.
please.
hello, starbuck.
kara, come on!
let's go! let's go! go! go!  get down!
kara, get down!
come on!
let's go! gotta go! hey.
come on!
move like you have a purpose, people!
go! go! go!  twenty-four ships, sir.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
why?  boomer they were conducting research,,, into human-cylon breeding programs, starbuck human-cylon?
they call them farms.
your  wound looks fine.
so, farms, that's great.
what were they gonna do? knock me up with some cylon kid? they were gonna try to.
we haven't been very successful so far.
supposedly, they can't reproduce you know, biologically so they've been trying every which way to produce offspring.
why? procreation, that's one of god's commandments.
be fruitful.
we can't fulfill it.
we've tried.
so we decided-- to rape human women.
you know, if you agreed to bear children, it'd be voluntary.
maybe even set you up with someone you like.
like you two kids?
we're different.
what the frak is that supposed to mean? they have this theory.
maybe the one thing they were missing was love.
so sharon and  we're set up-- to fall in love?
they didn't ask sue-shaun if she wanted to fall in love, all right?
they put a tube in her, and they hooked her up to a machine!
they know who you are, kara.
you're special.
leoben told you that.
you have a destiny.
starbuck, what's this second scar?
i don't know.
i don't think i wanna know now.
you know?
no.
all right, how many women do they have at these farms?
hundreds.
maybe thousands.
i don't know.
i haven't accessed that data.
here's what we do.
take the heavy raider, cram it full of ground troops find out where the next farm is, liberate it, then the next and the next, and the next.
no.
no, that's not why you came to caprica.
go find earth.
what about you? you said you needed professional advice.
we'll muddle through.
we've managed so far.
they'll kill you.
you'll die here.
you know that.
a lot of people died here but i'll tell you this: if i'm gonna die here i'm gonna take out every last one of those frakking farms before i do.
i'm not gonna leave you here.
you said you were gonna come back, remember?
i'm gonna hold you to it.
i'm coming back.
i said it.
i meant it.
yeah, okay.
hey.
be safe.
let's go home.
twelve cylon models seven are known four live in secre one will be revealed previously on battlestar galactica.
helo handpicked a crew for you.
i'm giving you a ship.
we liberated the demetrius.
a sewage recycling ship.
now go.
find a way to earth.
i'm telling you,guys, this thing is a setup anyway.
i mean,you think that the old man just gave her the ship and then cut her loose?
hey,that's enough of that crap. the resurrection ship didn't make the jump.
and now cavil's baseships are breaking formation, taking pos ionsaround our periphery.
they're going to attack.
they've taken out our ftl!
no resurrection ship.
they're really trying to kill us.
stay the frak away from me! i heard you.
you're cylons! a bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.
you think cally killed herself because of you,don't you? she th wght weere vihang an affair.
but we weren't.
no,that's right.
i'm not a cheater.i'm a cylon.
i'm not a priest.
but that doesn't matter,you see.
something in the universe loves me.
god only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you. he loves you because you are perfect just as you are.
captain.
captain!
i'm glad you're here.
i might have found something.
before that,we need to talk about making our rendezvous with the fleet.
later.
no,no.
no.come on.
here.
what do you think?
well.
it's hard to say.
spectroscopics are promising.
but according to this,we already did two long-range recons of that grid.
both no joy.
third time's the charm maybe.
all right, i'll have sharon prep to go as soon as anders gets back from his scout.
hey.
what about you? you been getting any sleep?
i don't know.notnot
much.
it was so clear when i first got back.
if i could if i could just focus, i know that i can find that sound again.
i gotta go see the cap off.
we'll talk when i get back.
hold up.
i think i'll go with you on this one.
yot haven'flowcaa since we left the fleet.
i think i'll go with you on this one.
i need you to tell me that all this somehow makes sense.
this was my husband,james.
my two children,danya and reece.
they were on picon when the cylons attacked.
what do you feel when you look at this photograph?
i feel rage.
against the cylons.
not just the machines.
anyone involved.
the engineers who designed them.
the corporations, the politicians who provoked this war and then did nothing to protect us.
and most of all the gods.
the gods.
they stood by and let it all happen.
yes,i know.
i know.
i am so sorry,phoebe.
i sympathize.
unfortunately,the gods cannot be blamed for not coming to your aid.
it's not because they weren't listening.
it's because they don't exist.
the gods we've been praying to for thousands of years do not exist.
they can't help you because they are not real.
we have been pandering to our own ignorance for far too long.
now on my own journey i've been wronged,persecuted.
i prayed to the gods on my knees begging them for mercy.
tortured.
i received nothing in resp i could've lived in that abyss of bitterness, but that will destroy you like nothing else.
but i chose to forgive.
and most importantly,i began with myself.
third time's the charm?
and you just went along with it?
it's called following orders,lieutenant.
it's called dragging our feet.
starbuck's pushing our go back deadline to the last second.
she's afraid of what adama's gonna say when he realizes her vision was just a pipe dream.
you've got to be kidding me.
she's taking a viper out now? she can't be serious.
maybe she could do a little finger painting i've heard enough bitching and  to last a lifetime.
two more days and we're back with the fleet,okay?
until then,everyone just shut up and do your jobs.
come on.
come on.
come on.
starbuck,hot dog.
didn't catch that.
what are your orders?
hot dog,demetrius.
you know the drill.
keep your eyes open and stick close to starbuck's wing.
i know you're out here somewhere.
come on.
starbuck,dradis contact.
demetrius,we've got an inbound.
one bogey bearing 1-4-9er.
roger that.
call action stations.
spool up the ftl for emergency jump.
action stations,action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship.
this is not a drill.
repeat,action stations,action stations.
this is not a drill.
son of a bitch,i knew it.
demetrius,hotdog.
i've got visual.
cylon heavy raider.
starbuck,demetrius.
report.
report!
demetrius,i'm seeing blast damage all over this thing.
starbuck,what are your orders?
come on.
talk to me,shoot me,do something.
starbuck,what are your orders?
kara.
i'm alone.
it's not an attack.
i knew i'd find you.
knew you'd be out here searching.
leoben?
i'm here for you,to offer a truce between cylon and human.
and a chance for you to complete your journey. in search of a home called earth battlestar galactica season episode heavy raider's docked at the aft airlock.
the animal part that controls it looks dead.
we only found the one leoben aboard.
starbuck's still taking one hell of a chance.
if he wanted to kill us, we'd all be dead by now.
just means he wants something else.
kara.
thank you for this.
we were praying for a miracle.
it wasn't a miracle.
it's like i knew you were out there.
i'm not picking up any gamma emissions,sir.
raider's packing conventional weaponry only.
no nukes.
all right.
keep checking for tracking devices.
anything that might give up our position.
don't look at me like that.
i'm sorry.
the difference between the way you were on new caprica and now is i'm the same person.
i have eyes.i
can see.
god has taken your hand and purged you of the questions,the doubt.
your journey can finally begin.
but there isn't much time.
the others,the ones i left behind, they need your help.
but not as much as you need theirs.
why? your crew.
they don't trust you.
i need you to tell me why you're here captain,we should move the prisoner.
a blue planet surrounded by clouds.
you okay? stop! the hybrid.
when she first described it to me, how beautiful it was,i cried.
you need to go to her,kara.
the hybrid,she'll tell you things.
amazing things.
we're done here.
get him out of here.
wait! take him to my quarters.
just do it!
it may never make any sense.
hangar deck crew tells me you've been obsessing over this place.
going over the logs.
replaying the accident again and again.
accident.
what is it?
i spoke to cottle.
cally was on moxopan and cosapine.
antidepressants.
how did she go from antidepressants to suicide? well,she was.
emotionally disturbed.
she would've left me.
she never would've left nicky behind.
so.
what do you think then?
someone killed her? galen,you have to let it go.
no,i gotta figure out what happened.
what if she knew?
how would she have known?
maybe she sensed it.
i mean,she was your wife.
you've been different since the nebula.
maybe she was afraid of you.
maybe it was god's will.
we don't know why these things happen.
but god does.
and he has plan for us.
for whatever reason,her death,our awakening, you gotta trust that it's all for the best.
why are you here?
because we are in this together.
and i am here for you,galen.
i know exactly where you are right now.
i have been there.
until gaius helped me realize that.
what.
wha vernehas go before,whatever i have done,it doesn't matter.
we can still change.
you spend way too much time with baltar.
so i guess i missed all the excitement,huh?
so what's the deal?
this leoben,has he said anything?
don't know.
starbuck ordered the s to wait outside,lose the cuffs. said she didn't want to be disturbed.
guess i'll talk to her. yeah,why don't you do that?
hey.
hey,hey,hey,hey!
get the hell away from her. sam--sam,stop it!
what is wrong with you,kara?
i can see why she's so fond of you.
just leave him alone.
you know--you know what we have to do.
just remember there isn't much time.
get him the frak out of here!
cuff him and lock him in storage!
what is going on with you? kara! he can help us.
the cylons,they understand about earth.
and you believe him?
after everything he's done to you? kara,he kept you locked up for months on new caprica.
the frakkin' mind games.
i swear to gods this is not a dream.
it's real.
i'm glad you're here.
you and kara,did you get things worked out? because you should.
you weren't meant to be enemies.
no.
that'd be you and me.
what do you want from kara? the same thing i've always wanted.
for her to understand her destiny.
that's not good enough.
it's good enough for her.
what is the most basic article of faith? that this is not all that we are.
c-bucks rule.
what did you just say? forward ,right?
i saw a couple games.
you were good.
yet after all the celebrity and acclaim,what were you?
just another face selling magazines.
another piece of scoreboard tri.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica:  sharon, get out of here!
where are you?
sharon!
tyrol: halt! no sudden moves.
get on your knees and cross your ankles.
now! i'm human.
i'm from oasis.
it's a hamlet, public stop.
i'm out of havoca city.
i'm not a cylon!
don't leave me! speaker: attention, the scorpia traveller has docked.
any civilians currently boarding galactica please proceed to security checkpoint.
thank you. speaker: flight maintenance crew bravo report to flight 3. corporal: next.
next.
man: yes, okay.
tyrol: it's all clear?
cally: i've got your back, chief.
thanks.
anybody see you? no.
i went through the hatch combing on causeway.
good girl.
speaker: bravo team, eod, stand by for munitions off-loading.
hangar bay 2.  you know, sometimes at work i try to conjure up what your face looks like.
the curve of your lips the way your hair falls, how you smell.
you see my face every day.
yeah, but not like this.
security, xo.
send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, level.
approach from the aft.
repeat.
approach from the aft.
doral!
what's the count?
three dead.
13 injured.
did you get a good look at the bomber?
yes. it was him, right?
yes.
i want to see the master at arms in my office in ten minutes.
a cylon?
hadrian: eyewitness accounts state the bomber was a man. the cylons look like us now.
like us? yes, they appear human.
the flesh, the blood the whole thing.
the bomber was another copy of a man we knew as doral posing as the public relations officer aboard this ship.
they've learned that there are multiple versions of the same cylon.
i want you to open an investigation immediately.
i want to find out how that cylon or any civilian could break through our security.
there's been a string of security incidents aboard ship, sir. the water tank , the discovery of explosives aboard a raptor and now this.
your point?
i need a free hand.
the authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead without command review.
independent tribunal?
yes, sir.
you'll get it.
hadrian: thank you. adama: that will be all, sergeant.
i also strongly recommend alerting the public to the cylon threat.
if there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet we should find them before they strike again.
i'll take that under advisement.
adama: that will be all.
hadrian: yes, sir.
open to the public.
there's a can of worms.
kee silent hasn't helped us very much.
maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up.
adama: all right.
adama: hey.
i owe you one.
sir.
colonel.
get me the president.
cally: don't kink the line.
jammer: there, we've got it.
socinus: okay, let's go.
so who's first?
how about me? hey, chief.
how's it going there, on top?
hi.
come on.
let's have it.
come on.
tyrol: you people are the sorriest of the sorry.
tyrol: the dumbest of the dumb.
tyrol: the only thing you're making out of this is a one-way trip to sick bay or the morgue.
now, tonight, after night call one of you brings me twice this length of copper tubing a spot heater and a co2 scrubber.
i'll show you people how this is done.
tyrol: all right?
now get the hell out of here before i change my mind.
tyrol: thank you. children.
no.
6: he's very handsome.
doral: you really think so? boomer: she says that about everyone.
no.
6: you disagree?
he's attractive.
no.
6: i hope you're more convincing than that with him.
if he wants to find me, he'll head north, toward cylon forces he's already seen.
if he wants to go alone, he'll go south, ho to find another way off the planet.
either way, he won't make his move until nightfall.
doral: if he flees, he dies.
roslin: there's going to be a huge reaction.
if there are any other cylons aboard any of our ships, we need to find them.
if we enlist the help of the public, it'll make it a lot easier.
people are going to be shocked, angry, terrified, paranoid.
there is a price to be paid when asking for the public's help.
they're going to demand, at the very least, that someone be held accountable.
i'm setting up a tribunal.
that tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name.
someone who screwed up.
we don't know if anybody screwed up. a cylon agent penetrated your security, killing three people.
at least one of your men or women screwed up.
look, here's my view: independent tribunal, openness, transparency, it all sounds great.
but after 20 years in political office, i'm telling you these things have a way of inflicting damage on the people you least expect.
i do not want a witch hunt on our hands.
hadrian: so, where were you at the time of the bombing? in my rack, reading some trashy novel socinus gave me.
did you see the chief?
chief? he was on the hangar deck going over some paperwork, i think.
hadrian: how do you know that if you were in your rack?
i saw him right before i turned in.
i was with cally playing pyramid in the mess hall corridor.
hadrian: you sure? jammer: yeah.
she's pretty good.
did you see the chief?
yeah, he was there.
i mean, not the whole time. he dropped in, watched us play for a while.
okay.
socinus: i was on watch.
hadrian: did you see the chief? the chief?
no. he wasn't on the hangar deck?
no.
wait.
yeah.
yeah, he was. he came in, did some work on one of the vipers that the captain rides.
thank you. asleep in my rack.
sure about that?
positive.
i was asleep, sergeant.
all right.
that'll be all for now.
good afternoon and thank you for coming.
please be seated.
i'm sure by now, word of the  on the galactica has spread to the entire fleet.
we offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women aboard this mighty ship. in consultation with commander adama i have appointed an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstances surrounding this .
also, in the interest of security and public safety i feel it is time to reveal certain information that has until now remained a tightly-ed secret.
this information was known only to myself, commander adama and a few select advisors.
the cat's out of the bag. the cylons have the ability to mimic human form.
they look like us now.
roslin: we have reason to believe that a cylon agent was responsible for the  aboard galactica.
this man has been identified as a cylon agent.
we believe him to be responsible for the bombing.
he evidently slipped aboard the galactica with a civilian group killed a marine , stole the explosives and detonated them killing three members of the crew and destroying himself.
roslin: this man has also been identified as a cylon.
and we now know that there are duplicates of each cylon model.
anyone seeing either of these two men at anytime, anywhere in the fleet should immediately contact the battlestar galactica and the office of the president.
now i'll take your questions.
they've known about this the whole time and they tell us now? cylon?
i mean, who's the cylon now? this is too much.
i don't even want to know this.
excuse me, sir.
will you come with us, please?
boomer: what?
why? tyrol: what's going on, sergeant?
hadrian: chief, we need you to come along as well.
you're arresting the chief?
socinus: who's arresting him?
no one is under arrest.
what's all this?
hadrian: step back.
lieutenant asked you a question, sergeant.
a tribunal has been convened to look into the cylon penetration of our defences.
it requires the presence of lt.
valerii and chief tyrol.
i am here to escort them to the wardroom.
sir.
very well.
crashdown: proceed.
hadrian: thank you, sir.
lieutenant, chief, you'll come with me, please.
you're it till i get back.
don't worry.
hadrian: lt.
valerii, where were you at the time of the ?
i was in my rack.
asleep.
hadrian: did anyone see you, sir? boomer: i don't know.
i was asleep.
hadrian: lieutenant is it true that you and the chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship in violation of the colonial code of military conduct?
i thought this was about just answer the question, please.
are you and the chief involved in a relationship?
no. the xo ordered us to put a stop to it.
and so we did.
hadrian: sir, can you testify as to the whereabouts of chief petty officer tyrol at the time of the bombing?
i have no idea where he was.
thank you, sir.
you're excused, lieutenant.
but i am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing you are excused, lieutenant.
hadrian: bring in the next witness, please.
hadrian: the testimony you give before this tribunal may be used to adjudicate your guilt or innocence in the matter under investigation.
do you understand? yes.
hadrian: the matter being investigated is first how a cylon, penetrated galactica's security system and second, whether one of galactica's crew members aided and abetted this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the cylons.
collusion with the cylons?
hadrian: do you consent to give your testimony freely without invoking your right to remain silent as provided for under the 23rd article of colonization?
i do.
then let's begin.
cally: they're going after the chief.
jammer: they're going after the cylons.
what the hell does that mean?
wake up. the world's changed while you were asleep.
socinus: frak you.
cylons look like people.
that means anyone.
anyone.
not the chief.
how do you know?
i know.
this is stupid.
you two just don't want to deal with reality.
jammer: you want to keep your heads buried in the sand.
that's exactly what the cylons want.
for us to turn on each other.
cally: start getting suspicious, paranoid.
socinus: she's right.
if we don't believe in each other when the heat comes down, we're nothing.
that kind of thinking is over.
it's every man for himself now.
you better watch your backs.
hadrian: you had the mid-watch before the bombing, correct?
yes.
would you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch?
tyrol: i walk the perimeter of the hangar deck the tool rooms, storage facilities.
to make sure all hatches are sealed?
tyrol: yes.
that no unauthorised personnel is poking around where they shouldn't?
that's right.
and there was no one on the hangar deck that night.
hadrian: i believe that's what your log says.
what about the hatch combing for causeway c? anybody see you? no.
i went through the hatch combing on causeway.
hadrian: your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed.
if that's what the log indicates, then that's the case.
which would include the hatch combing for causeway c? i don't know where the sergeant is going with this.
tyrol: but they're not related.
hadrian: what if i told you that i found the hatch open after the bombing?
i would say that i don't know how that's possible.
it's not just any hatch on the hangar deck. it opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker where a marine  was found dead at the scene.
the locker was opened with the correct code.
do you have the correct code to that locker, chief?
yes, i do, as do dozens of others, including the .
it's possible the cylon forced the  to open it before he killed him.
i want to take this opportunity to state that, that was an internal security matter.
and this falls under the purview of the master at arms. and the master at arms is sergeant hadrian.
did lt.
valerii leave the hatch combing open last night?
i have no idea who left the hatch combing open last night.
chief, were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing?
no. were you working on a viper at that time?
no. were you watching a pick-up game of pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing?
no! as i told you earlier today, i was asleep in my rack.
hadrian: then why do i have three different statements from three of your deckhands stating variously that they all saw you and you were anywhere but in your rack?
chief tyrol, where were you at the time of the bombing?
hadrian: were you, in fact, meeting with a cylon agent?
i exercise my right under article 23. by invoking the 23rd article at this time, the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt.
so i will ask you one last time.
who were you with at the time of the bombing and was this person a cylon agent?
hadrian: your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch at the time of the bombing and that you saw chief tyrol work on one of the vipers.
is that true? yes, sir.
specialist, can you explain to us why chief tyrol told us in his testimony that he was in his rack asleep at the time of the bombing?
hadrian: speak up, specialist.
socinus: he said that? did you see him or didn't you?
hadrian: specialist!
socinus: no, i did not, sir.
so the chief did not come to the hangar deck after all?
i don't know.
i left my post.
excuse me? i left my post, sir.
i ducked out to get a smoke.
i went to the galley to get some chow.
the chief i mean, i don't know where he was.
i'm sure he was asleep in his rack just like he said.
you went to the galley?
yes, sir.
did you go through the hatch combing on deck?
well, to get to the galley, that would be the best way.
yes, sir, i went through that hatch.
did you leave it open?
i'm not sure.
yes, sir.
i think i did. the chief had nothing to do with it.
it was me.
i left my post and i left the hatch open.
it was me.
just me.
you realise, that by leaving the hatch open, you allowed a cylon to gain access to the small arms locker?
yes, sir.
specialist, did chief tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately as part of a conspiracy to allow the cylon to gain access to the small arms locker? the chief is innocent.
he didn't do anything.
specialist, did you leave the hatch open deliberately?
yes, sir.
whatever happened, it was me.
just me.
south.
you overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you. he just doesn't love you.
wait.
north.
toward his love.
seems you made an impression after all.
he's a good man. he always does the right thing.
are you prepared for the next step?
yes.
hello, lieutenant.
doctor.
i brought you a cigar.
a recovery gift.
how are you?
i'm good.
the food is good, company is better.
yes, i just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sick bay.
baltar: i thought i would see how you were doing.
so, doctor your super secret project's on deck, right?
i'm not at liberty to divulge exactly what i am doing on deck.
but you're more than welcome to pop by.
once you're ambulatory.
the bomber was on deck, right?
yes, i know.
i heard the .
very frightening.
do you think that's where he was headed?
i'm sorry.
i didn't follow you.
the cylon bomber?
do you think that he was trying to blow up your project?
no.
6: and you along with it?
it's funny.
i hadn't thought of that.
kind of hits you where you live, huh? yes, it does, actually.
you get well soon.
baltar: they're trying to kill me.
me, always me. they're trying to destroy your work.
no.
6: destroying you is an added bonus.
baltar: but why? baltar: i don't understand.
why are they trying to blow me up? baltar: you told me what to do.
baltar: i wouldn't be making this cylon detector if it wasn't for you.
no.
6: but i'm just in your head, gaius.
they don't know about me or us or our life together.
how romantic.
i'm going to have to destroy that cylon detector myself.
blame the sabotage on cylon agents.
that's what i'll tell adama.
no, you won't.
you're gonna complete the project just like i told you.
really?
would i? or what?
don't make me angry, gaius.
you wouldn't like me when i'm angry.
doral: sharon.
no.
6: is that enough?  no, sharon wouldn't give up without a much earned fight.
adama: did you read the tribunal report?
roslin: yes.
and i'm sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy and collusion with a cylon agent.
specialist socinus.
but after reading the transcripts i have my doubts.
what about this other man, your chief tyrol, he took the 23rd?
what is that about, do you think?
it's his right.
the courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent can be used as evidence of guilt.
you sound like a lawyer.
my father was a lawyer.
civil liberties.
let's set aside the legalities for a moment.
obviously, you are defending your man.
i respect that, i do.
but he is hiding something.
chief tyrol has been under my command for over five years.
and if he had really wanted to take this ship down he could.
this is over.
madam president, i'm gonna have to call you right back.
what?
i have orders to bring you before the tribunal, sir.
let's go.
helo: it's okay.
boomer: helo.
what's happening?
helo: can you walk? boomer: i think so.
helo: come on.
i got you.
okay.
now we're even.
i think we should go.
right.
okay.
helo: come on.
it's going to be all right.
you're going to be just fine.
hadrian: commander adama, when did you first learn the truth about the cylons?
on ragnar station.
before we left.
and you chose to withhold this crucial information, sir? adama: yes.
hadrian: why? i felt that to alarm the public, would only cause chaos and panic.
but you also withheld the information from your own security detachment aboard ship, sir.
not knowing who to trust, i decided to keep the information compartmentalised for the time being.
sir, isn't it true that had we known that the cylons appeared human different security procedures would have been followed?
probably.
but i had to weigh the possible ramifications of both.
hadrian: isn't it also true, sir, that had different procedures been followed the bombing may have been prevented?
that's speculative.
i'm asking if it's possible.
i know what you're asking, sergeant.
i will not speculate as to what might have happened.
do you personally believe that a cylon agent planted explosives in the ship's water tank?
yes.
do you believe that there are cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak?
yes, i do.
hadrian: sir, isn't it true that you knew that lt.
valerii and chief tyrol were having an illicit relationship in violation of regulations?
i don't see the relevance of this line of questioning, sergeant.
the commander should bear in mind that my questions are not subject to the commander's review.
why did you allow the relationship to continue knowing it was against regulations?
i'm a soft touch.
sir, are you aware that both lt.
valerii and chief tyrol have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the cylons?
i'm aware of the allegations.
where are you going with this? i will ask the questions, sir.
isn't it true that by allowing their relationship to continue in violation of regulations you may have made it possible for two cylon collaborators to compromise the safety and security of this ship?
we're done here.
excuse me, sir, but my questions are not finished.
you've lost your way, sergeant.
you've lost sight of the purpose of the law to protect its citizens, not persecute them.
whatever we are, whatever is left of us.
we're better than that.
adama: now these proceedings are closed.
you'll be transported back to your ships, and we appreciate your help.
myson: commander.
this is an independent board.
you have no authority to close our inquiry.
this is a witch hunt.
i will not have it aboard my ship.
corporal of the !
restrain the commander and return him back to the witness chair.
your orders are to escort sergeant hadrian back to her quarters and keep her in confinement until further notice.
make your choice, son.
sergeant hadrian, you'll come with us, please.
man: she's just about to speak.
woman: yes, i tried to get an interview with her myself.
good evening, have a seat.
the investigation into the suicide bombing aboard galactica and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close.
you are all aware that the bomber was a cylon agent.
the tribunal has determined that the cylon gained access to the explosives by going through a hatch door in the hangar deck of the ship.
this door was left open due to negligence of one of the ship's crewmen.
his name is specialist socinus. he has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in a time of war. he has been stripped of his rank and confined to the brig.
at this point, we have no reason to believe that there were any other parties responsible.
now i'll take your questions.
you, sir.
tyrol: commander, permission to enter?
adama: what is it, chief?
tyrol: thank you, sir.
sir, i believe that socinus i believe that his confession was a lie.
i think that he's covering for me.
for you?
i think that he's doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.
somewhere in this there's truth.
care to take me to it?
sir, i was with lt.
valerii at the time of the bombing.
the deck gang, they all knew it.
they've known all along.
tyrol: they're trying to cover for me.
they started lying.
socinus i think that he thinks he's hel protect me by taking a fall like this.
you don't really know if he was on duty or not, do you?
commander, he's innocent.
i know that much.
i should be in the brig.
well, that's a fact.
you should be in the brig.
commander, this isn't right.
you can't let an innocent kid i can't?
what i can't do is i can't let someone that wears this uniform get on the witness stand and lie under oath.
and that's what your man did. he either lied the first time or he lied the second time.
and it doesn't matter.
he's guilty and he'll pay the price.
adama: you? you'll pay a different price.
you'll have to walk out on that hangar deck every day knowing that one of your men is in the brig because you couldn't keep your fly zipped.
you're the most experienced, noncommissioned officer we have left.
you keep my planes flying.
i need my planes to fly.
dismissed.
sir.
tyrol: sharon, no.
boomer: what?
sharon, we're done.
it's over.
what do you mean it's over?
i love you.
i really do.
i'm sorry.
wait a minute.
boomer: i deserve more of an explanation than that.
sure.
one of my men is in the brig. he confessed to a crime he didn't commit to protect me, to protect us.
there can be no more us.
no more secrets, no more lies, that's it.
it's over.
i can't believe you can just turn your back on us.
i put everything on the line for you.
everything.
i cover for you, i protect you.
tyrol: i risk my career, my freedom, my integrity, for what?
so some innocent kid, one of my kids, can take the fall for me? tyrol: no! we are not worth that.
okay.
right.
i guess i'll see you around.
one more thing.
did you leave the hatch combing open last night?
what? did you leave the hatch combing open last night?
what are you saying?
boomer: that i helped the cylon?
tyrol: i didn't say anything.
i'm just asking a question.
i think i deserve an answer.
you have the only answer you're ever gonna get.
.
male narrator previously on battlestar galactica.
deep down in that thing you call a subconscious you know how many cylons there are left in the fleet.
eight!
there are eight!
cpl.
venner reports the former president's missing.
missing?
two men down, cell's empty.
damn it.
zarek glad to see you, madam president.
well, mr.
zarek.
it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
go find her.
let's go home.
roslin we have found kobol, and when we retrieve the arrow, we will open the tomb of athena,,, and we will find the road to earth.
no one's gonna believe this crap.
and anyone that wants to make a suicide run to kobol, let them.
astral queen has jumped away.
gaeta twenty-four ships, sir.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
they're gonna follow roslin to kobol to their death.
dualla aboard the 24 ships that joined former president roslin's rebellion, sir.
tigh that's over a third of the people in the fleet.
give me a breakdown.
what have we lost?
dualla not who.
what.
i'm not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist.
that's their business.
now, what have i lost?
twelve transports, seven freighters three construction platforms a private cruiser and a mining ship, sir. the monarch was a blow.
we can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation.
and then there's the collateral damage.
morale is down throughout the fleet.
the press is going wild, families are being split apart-- don't talk to me about family.
apollo i support the president completely, and my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
that's all well and good, but he's still adama's son.
man  yeah! woman yes! when push comes to shove how do we know he'll be willing to stand up-- if it were not for him, i would still be in a galactica jail cell.
i trust him completely and this subject is closed.
and what about galactica?
they know where we are.
they could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
zarek we're not entirely defenseless.
some of our ships are armed.
we should take steps to arm the others, just in case.
just in case we want to commit suicide.
if galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it.
nothing.
and nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
at this point, it's my firm belief that cdr.
adama has let us go.
lt.
thrace will return.
she will have the arrow of apollo and it will help us find our way to earth.
and exactly how long should we wait for her? i mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now.
go down now and start looking for this tomb.
i wouldn't be too eager.
there may still be cylons present.
and some of us will die down there.
the scriptures tell us that any return to kobol carries with it a cost in blood.
roslin people i realize that there are still many  unanswered questions here.
but i refuse to lose sight of what  this has always been about: our mission to save humanity.
yes, it's a big one.
but it is our foretold destiny and l, for one, am not going to waver from it now.
roslin if there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission you are welcome to rejoin cdr.
adama's fleet.
it jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago.
no colonial transponder, and it's too large to be thrace's cylon raider.
and no response to our hails?
meier not a peep, tom.
it's either a cylon vessel or it's a raptor scout from galactica, either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
okay.
the adriatic is in weapons range and she's got ship-to-ship missiles.
tom, that thing is moving fast.
if we're  gonna shoot it down, we better shoot it down.
shoot what down?
do i have to repeat myself?
madam president, we have a security situation, that's all.
she wasn't talking to you.
there's an unidentified ship making its way towards us.
zarek it's too big to be the lieutenant's cylon raider.
it's in weapons range.
the adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
we need a decision, madam president.
starbuck  civilian vessels, civilian vessels,,, this is starbuck, do you read?
do you read? say again, this is starbuck, is anybody getting this?
hello?
hello?
male voice  initiate docking,  good to see you, too, captain.
remind me to send you to the brig later.
yeah, well.
lieutenant.
lee, there's something i need to tell you.
lee, wait! don't you frakking move!
stop!
she's with us.
drop your weapon, sir.
drop your weapon.
helo.
gentlemen, i'm only going to say this once.
capt.
adama, and.
what is your name?
lt.
agathon.
apollo he used to be sharon's eco.
i thought you were dead, helo.
you a cylon, too? don't even-- roslin all right, here's what we're gonna do.
you're gonna lower your weapons.
am i being perfectly clear?
what about sharon?
she will be taken to a holding cell, where she will remain unharmed.
helo okay.
how about it, apollo?
should we do what the nice lady says?
she's the president of the colonies, you moron.
and yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says.
lower your weapons, now.
roslin thank you. now, put that thing out the airlock.
what?
we don't keep cylons around here, lieutenant.
what the frak?
you said you weren't gonna hurt her! no! apollo hey, helo! listen to me! one of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
it wasn't me! adama was shot?
apollo yes.
you missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
please tell me he's alive.
yes.
after two emergency surgeries, cottle managed to save him.
boomer that wasn't me.
kara! for the love of gods.
boomer wait! listen!
sharon, this sharon, saved our lives back on caprica.
tell them.
tell them.
i know how to find the tomb of athena.
do you?
kobol's a big planet.
you don't find the tomb, you don't find earth.
listen to her, for gods' sakes.
listen to me!  madam president.
tell them to wait a minute.
aide yes, sir.
thank you. mr.
zarek, is there someplace where that young woman and can speak?
i can arrange that.
it's great to see you again, kara.
thanks for bringing in the trash.
looks like we missed all the fun.
perry?
no.
well, mueller.
you know, mueller's not a bad choice.
tigh he did a tour as a squadron x.o.
mueller's a malcontent.
i know you don't want to hear this but there is not another apollo in this bunch and we do have to pick a new cag.
birch cdr.
adama.
lt.
birch.
please, come in.
thank you for coming in such short notice. of course, sir.
i'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet.
several of our pilots departed.
i was just thinking that we needed a new cag to step up.
absolutely, sir.
who's it going to be? congratulations, captain.
it's you.
thank you, sir.
i just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew. is that not right, colonel?
absolutely.
here's your log book.
congratulations.
i'm honored, commander.
i won't let you down.
and sir, i'd just like to say that i was a tremendous supporter of your son.
capt.
adama. he was a great leader, sir. a ship is a family.
it works on trust, understanding, and love.
i love everyone on this ship as much as i love my.
my sons.
galactica is still a family.
you're an important part of that family.
do you understand? yes, sir.
thank you, george.
i'm sure you'll do a fine job.
what the hell?
you got me in here jawing about picking a new cag and you've already made your choice?
i just wanted to see if you and i were on the same page or not.
i beg your pardon?
i guess we're not.
you guessed right.
you're telling me that kid is leadership material?
we have very few choices and he's the best.
he's a good man, saul.
he's honest and he's loyal.
we need a little bit of that around here right now.
well, it's your call.
i'll support it.
commander.
all cdr.
adama!
can you tell us about.
can you make any comments regarding laura roslin.
please be seated.
this thing working?
please be seated.
lady reporter will you be finally addressing those issues?
lady reporter commander, will you be responding-- allow me to make a statement, please.
please allow me to make a statement.
please be seated.
thank you very much.
if you don't already know, the fleet has been divided.
adama wait! we share the grief of friends lost.
and the resources we've sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us.
but if we stay together we will rise to the occasion as we have before.
questions? all here!
yes? do you know the coordinates the whereabouts of president roslin's rebellion?
do you intend to put the fleet back together?
first of all, laura roslin is no longer president.
she relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship.
next question.
but, commander-- commander-- yes, go ahead.
man since the fleet has been divided-- commander, you haven't answered my question yet.
we have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal who has chosen to remain with us.
this is the fleet.
thank you. this is the fleet?
male reporter commander?
commander? is there any truth to the rumor that there is no earth it doesn't exist and you just made it up?
what the hell kind of question is that?
it's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
freedom of the press is not a license to slander.
broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell.
that goes for all of you.
tigh we're done here.
get your hands off me.
why don't you calm down?
remind me not to do that again.
always looked easy enough when roslin did it.
there was an old footbridge over the euclid river.
i used to go there when i was a boy.
watch the fish try and swim upstream.
they were mesmerizing.
i envied them unaware as they were of the wider complexities, challenges of life.
you're beginning to see human beings as we see them.
what i am beginning to see are cylon faces, everywhere i look.
sharon told me there were eight cylons left in the fleet.
why didn't i ask her who they were?
if that idiot hadn't shot her. and why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well-- gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things.
they do have it easy, don't they?
they?
why are you talking to me like i'm not one of them? in some ways, you never were.
you have a path.
you will be spared their fate.
for once, gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course.
if there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty they are masters of self-destruction.
because i love him.
and because i'm carrying his child.
oh, i see, that explains it.
you're not here because you mean us any harm or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity.
you're here because you had an affair with one of our raptor pilots. listen to me.
i'm listening to you.
that's my mistake.
i'm listening to a cylon.
i am here because i chose to come here.
and i know you don't believe me.
but hear this, even if you find the tomb even if you find the map, and even if you find earth the price you pay will be too high.
i'm not interested in your prophecies.
i know that there is a cylon force on kobol.
i know it's dangerous.
and i have little doubt that you are communicating everything i say even as we speak.
it doesn't work like that.
i'm not wired in.
sharon, it's simple.
what i need to know and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the tomb of athena.
get me a map and i will do my best to tell you how to get to the tomb.
no, you'll do better than your best.
i want to know where it is and you either know or you don't.
we all know about the tomb.
i can show you the path.
i don't know how long the path is, or exactly where it leads to but i can tell you that you're gonna have to move very, very quickly.
she claims to love lt.
agathon.
she says she loves the baby she's carrying.
who cares what she says?
you can't believe a word, any of them.
the scrolls of pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
more superstition.
i've told her that unless we return from kobol with a map to earth that lt.
agathon will be put out the airlock as a cylon conspirator.
is that true? doesn't matter if it's true.
she believed it.
she saved them, both of them.
she didn't have to.
she could've saved her child and let them die.
why didn't she? because i believe that she's telling the truth about one thing she thinks she's in love.
even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her. she wants her baby to live.
she wants agathon to live.
we use that.
this is not the way that i thought things were gonna go down.
i knew they'd be suspicious, but.
they're human the way you are.
meier has anyone stopped to consider that the reason sharon knows so much about kobol is because it's a cylon trap?
i've done more than consider it.
it is clearly possible we're facing a trap.
capt.
apollo has already warned us that cylon encounter in the region is probable.
has capt.
apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know? he is in charge of this mission.
he is second in command only to myself.
i strongly encourage you to remember that, mr.
meier.
whatever the risks, whatever the consequences, i am going anyway.
i am committed.
dualla  capt, birch, galactica.
you're cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge, birch  galactica.
leader, wilco, cag to all vipers, we're initiating our precision- exercise as planned, hotdog, you're first up, kat, on deck, hotdog  leader, hotdog, cleared to target, executing eyeball run,,, on three, two, one, away,  hotdog frak! winged it, birch come on, people, i know this is just a drill,,, but let's look sharp out there, hotdog, i know you can do a lot better, let's try it again, see if you can put the next one in the x-ring.
cleared hot,  ready for another pass, leader, kat, i'm confirming that i'm cleared for my attack run,   am i clear?
executing eyeball run.
affirmative, you're clear.
rolling in.
weapons hot.
kat leader, kat, did you say all clear?
birch i said all clear, okay, roger that.
let's go, baby.
hotdog here we go! three, two, one, away!
kat leader, beginning strafing run, kat, what are you doing?
you said i'm clear for my attack run.
hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
what?
hotdog?
back off, kat! now! now! now!   oh, my gods!
yeah! bang on!
did you see that?  bang on?
hotdog, you frakking idiot!
you almost got me killed!
hotdog what are you talking about?
kat birch, you said i was clear!
birch all vipers, this is leader, repeat, all vipers, this is leader, report back to galactica.
report back to galactica.
frak! i know how you feel, i get it.
but i didn't shoot him, okay? it wasn't me.
you're all the same.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
then maybe i'm done talking.
i think there's been enough of that today.
you are the last one that should be telling me what to do after the stunt you pulled.
stealing the cylon raider and then tearing ass back to caprica? yeah, i guess you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh? you know what, you have no idea what happened to me on caprica.
so while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about captain.
meier what roslin's doing is reckless.
we have our own fleet now.
how much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader?
we have a fleet because people believe roslin's going to lead them to earth.
she's a fraud.
you don't believe her, do you?
no, but i believe in the power of myth.
i'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this.
and in the end, president or prophet, it doesn't really matter.
she still needs a commander, a man in charge of the fleet.
the man with the guns makes the rules.
what if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet?
what if she has someone else in mind?
someone already close to her, like a certain captain?
let's say you're right, that on some level based on their belief in the scriptures the fleet needs laura roslin in order to stay in line.
so we do what we must in order to keep roslin safe on the surface of kobol.
but.
but? you're right.
you're absolutely right.
how could i have not have seen that?
i want to set this fleet on a path to freedom. of course.
i want to deliver unto them the liberty we've promised.
we are far from daylight, my friend.
the scriptures say some of us will die on kobol.
one man in particular.
birch tank to striker, your approach is a little off the center line, striker, reset your delta to 0.35, acknowledge.
striker striker, how's my approach speed?
birch tanker to striker, your angle vectors are too steep for junct, i repeat, your angle vectors are too steep for junct, striker tanker, request heading, one-tenth of the way, what is he doing?
birch this is tanker, tell him to cut his speed.
what is it this time?
i'm glad you're here.
birch is coordinating the ships for refueling but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book!
how long has he been at it?
about four hours now.
sir, he's too green.
he's blowing the approach and the docking speeds he's missing the drogues, he's bunching the lines.
it's a mess out there.
as you know, this isn't the first screw-up.
yes, i know.
i realize that he is your guy.
but he's no apollo.
striker moving on 709,,,, i was wondering when we'd finally get a little and around here.
oh, boy.
can i have my ball back?
what, i can't hold it?
can i have my ball back, please?
where'd you get a pyramid ball, anyway?
caprica.
can i have my ball back, lee? yeah, sure.
lee.
keep it.
hey come on, kara.
for frak's sake, i'm just kidding around.
all right, here, it's all yours.
you can take your ball and go home now.
the whole thing's stupid anyway.
what's up with you, kara?
anything you want to talk about?
nope.
must have been hard being back on caprica being home.
probably saw some tough things back there.
anyway, tomorrow this whole thing's gonna end, one way or another.
we find the tomb or we don't.
we find a way to earth or we don't.
i just want you to know, kara, that i'm your friend.
i love you.
if there's anything you want to talk about anything you wanna get off your chest, then i'm here for you.
anyway, whenever you wanna talk just let me know.
what was that middle part again?
what do you mean? did you say you love me? well.
lee adama loves me.
no.
all i meant was-- no, seriously, very sweet.
you love me.
no, you love me.
you can't take it back.
there's no take-backs.
you're dreaming it, kara.
you love me.
you're dreaming it.
you love me.
dreamer.
mmm-hmm.
okay.
this is striker, i'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar, can you redirect?
gas station, striker's coming in way too hot.
emmitt you gotta back off your delta, like right now, striker roger that, correcting approach angle, emmitt didn't you hear us? back off your delta, you're too close!
are you listening?
okay.
birch we are not too close, abort.
abort the op.
striker, remain on target, recall the ships.
galactica, all ships involved in fuel unrep, abort mission.
say again, abort fuel unrep.
raptors, return to base, acknowledge.
birch wilco, galactica.
aborting mission, damn it!
birch roger that, galactica says abort approach, attempt angle vector full reverse, striker, you're still on a collision course, put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters, back off, look out!   emmitt galactica, emmitt, tanker's intact, no wireless contact, but it's in an axis spin and there does appear to be some damage, away rescue team, tell them to board the tanker and restore navigational control.
man away rescue team, to section 046,  here.
you never know when you might need to defend yourself.
here we go.
and the blaze pursued them, and the people of kobol had a choice to board the great ship or take the high road through the rocky ridge.
and the body of each tribe's leader was offered to the gods in the tomb of athena.
yes.
precisely.
and the great ship was a galleon that departed from here, where we're standing.
and it took the founders of the 13 colonies to their destiny.
and those that didn't board the galleon took the high road the rocky ridge that led to the tomb.
let's move.
the path is supposed to be marked by gravestones.
there's something there.
wait!    get back!
get back!
get back!
helo sharon!
sharon, take cover!
switch.
nice one.
ammo! here.
lee, no!   you gotta be frakking kidding me.
not bad.
adama it's interesting.
betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind.
it's almost like a python.
it can squeeze out all other thought suffocate all other emotion, until everything is dead except for the rage.
i'm not talking about anger.
i'm talking about rage.
i can feel it, right here iike it's gonna burst.
i feel like i wanna scream right now, matter of fact.
if i may say something.
speak your mind, dee.
i don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed.
i think it's that you feel helpless.
you were shot, you were injured, you couldn't do anything.
don't make excuses for me.
and when you finally had a chance to do something-- i'm sorry i did this.
you let us down.
you let us down.
you made a promise to all of us to find earth to find us a home together.
it doesn't matter what the president did, or even what lee did.
because every day that we remain apart is a day that you've broken your promise.
people aboard those ships made their own decision.
it was their decision, not mine.
thank you, petty officer.
you may leave now.
you asked to talk to me, sir.
maybe because you think that i don't have anything to say.
but i do.
it's time to heal the wounds, commander.
people have been divided.
i said, that's enough.
children are separated from their parents.
a cost in blood.
let's go, madam president.
adama mr.
gaeta.
i want to see all recon material on kobol immediately in my quarters.
aye, sir.
tigh kobol?
yes.
i'm putting the fleet back together.
i'm putting our family back together.
this ends now.
previously on battlestar galactica madame president, are you taking chamalla again?
i am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
i remember a flashing triple star, a giant gas planet with rings, and a comet.
what's the latest, felix?
she's reversing course.
returning to sector seven.
that is the tenth course correction.
frak me.
they're going to attack.
alert the others.
we need to jump now.
just remember, they started it.
but we're killing them.
we are truly killing them.
dradis contact.
i've got visual.
cylon heavy raider.
kara, i'm alone.
this is not an attack.
i knew i'd find you.
leoben.
i'm here for you. to offer a truce between human and cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
the hybrid.
you need to go to her, kara.
she'll tell you the way to get to earth.
we're done here.
get him out of here.
this baseship was never part of the mission.
if we don't leave right now, we are all going to die. on your order.
we're not going back to the fleet.
are you talking about? to complete a mission, that baseship has captain thrace, as xo of the demetrius, i'm hereby relieving you of command.
you son of a bitch.
i'll do it myself.
what the hell are you doing?! stand down!
order the marine s to the control room.
tell them i'm placing captain thrace under arrest.
you're wrong, helo.
you're so godsdamn wrong.
either way, we're taking leoben and his proposal back to the fleet.
the admiral will sort it out.
re throwing away our last chance to find earth.
and you'll be going back to galactica as mutineers.
how do you think the admiral's gonna sort through that?
that's up to him.
m. gaeta, reset the ftl for the first jump back to the fleet.
right away, sir.
we should just airlock your cylon ass.
i am not a cylon.
gaeta, stop!
gaeta, abort the jump!
i said, abort the jump!
frak.
you want to know who's in charge?
who's in command?
you frakkin' want to know?! sam! it's captain thrace, gods damn it!
let her go!
sergeant, stand down.
stand down, sergeant!
medic!
stand down, sergeant!
that's an order!
seelix, stand down!
stand down.
what the frak?
i need a med kit! stay away from me.
frak! what the frak?
all right, bloodstopper.
this is gonna hurt.
ready, go.
get off me, you frakkin' bitch morpha.
we need to move him to a bunk.
marines, get over here!
yes, sir.
easy.
careful!
wait, listen.
kara, that was so now what?
gonna give orders at gunpoint?
you're right, helo.
i never should've ordered demetrius to jump to the baseship.
too many lives to risk on a gut instinct.
so demetrius goes back to the fleet.
missing a raptor.
to the baseship, see if his story checks out.
are you insane? the two of you alone?
she's not going alone.
i'm going with her. this is crazy, but i need you.
what?
speaking their language.
if this is a trap, i want to know about it.
hell, yeah, let the cylon go.
it's okay.
i'll do it.
listen to me.
your raptor doesn't have enough fuel to get back to galactica.
but the baseship does.
we were sent out here by the admiral to complete a mission.
not for me, but for the people of the fleet.
and if i'm right, the payoff is earth.
lieutenant costanza, what's the latest we can leave here and still make the rendezvous with the fleet?
window closes and that's cutting it really damn close.
set the clock to 15 hours and minutes and start it.
we'll be waiting here till the clock runs out.
battlestar galactica season - episode transcript = swsub.com
- = sadgeezer.com
- thanks, insults, critics so i guess just pack up everything that's here.
pack up all of these drafts.
will have plenty of time on my hands over the next couple of days, so pack it up.
at least the worst is over.
and you will be over the hump.
and i'm gonna need you to really keep an eye on things until then.
don't worry.
i'll make sure our friend from picon sees the error of his ways.
i'm not just talking about the quorum, tory.
there was a time a few months ago when you seemed overwhelmed by the stresses and the pressures of this job.
but lately you've really stepped up.
and i'm gonna be demanding even more of that from you in the days to come, because i'm not quite sure of what i'm doing right.
i'm sort of i'm just gonna need you to keep a keen eye on every single thing that comes across this desk.
i appreciate your confidence, madame president.
thank you. let's go.
just remember, if this is a trap, you die first.
preflight is complete.
i need to know.
do i need to watch my back with you on this? no, i said i'd go.
you have my word.
be like a homecoming for you. the other eights talk about you all the time.
keep him the frak away from me.
barolay, i didn't ask for volunteers.
yeah, you did, back on galactica.
they think.
you've been kicking ass since day one.
you say you can find earth.
wanna be there when you do.
you have 14 hours and 40 minutes.
godspeed.
copy that.
can you feel it?
the anticipation.
god's plan is about to be revealed.
you better hope so for your sake.
three, two, one, jump.
multiple contacts, all quadrants.
looks like we found what's left of them.
how you doing, felix?
never better.
those frakkers won't give me any more morpha.
afraid i'll od or something.
yeah, i know.
will you promise me something?
anything.
don't let cottle take my leg.
you're gonna be all right.
don't frak with me.
karl.
i know every minute that we stay here means it's more likely that he's gonna have to.
please.
okay, promise me.
felix, you know damn well i won't leave until the clock runs out.
all right, where's the baseship?
don't know.
if it's still in one piece, dradis is too cluttered to see it.
watch yourselves.
we've got ordinance looks like he wasn't lying about a civil war.
this is it.
this is the place.
i can hear it.
the unstruck music vibrates in all of us.
few can hear it.
kara's one of the few.
got a course for us?
give me the ship.
starbuck, you have any idea where you're going? the comet.
the it's the ship.
this is what i was meant to see.
incoming, right, two high!
she's back.
oh, frak.
kara.
no, no.
take it easy, kara.
everybody made it okay.
you'll be fine.
no, don't touch it.
we need to get her out of here.
get her some air.
get the frak away from me! they call you athena now.
you even wear their uniform like you're one of them.
you were the first to say no.
no to what? the entire plan.
you joined the humans.
you had a child.
you showed us that we don't have to be slaves to our programming.
we wanted the same thing, but it turned out to be a disaster.
the sixes have made one mistake after another.
they have to be stopped before they get the rest of us killed.
ask.
you could help us.
you want me to lead a mutiny against the sixes.
it's the only way.
you guys make me sick.
why? because you pick your side and you stick.
you don't cut and run when things get ugly.
otherwise you'll never have anything.
no love, no family.
no life to call your own.
now you guys can either help me or get the hell out of my way.
'cause he will take your hand guide you to the other side when you're feeling a little better.
can't you read a chart?
i'm not gonna feel better.
so take your needles and your thermometers and your catheters and stick 'em where the sun doesn't shine.
the undiscovered country hello.
oh, great.
now the president.
she stuck me three times today.
be thankful she hasn't put a catheter in you.
where we will bask in the radiance of god's love.
all this just to keep me alive for a few more days.
it's so pointless.
no, it's not pointless.
and i'm sure it isn't hel listening to gaius baltar no, no, no, don't touch that! who the frak do you think you are? accept him into your hearts leave me alone! it is all about love.
it's not about living a righteous life.
god doesn't really care how many good deeds we've done.
this is the mistake that i find that so many of the pious the hybrid will want to see you, i know it.
let's go then.
what are you doing?
you want to give her access to the central nervous system of this ship?
i thought we had a deal.
we discussed this.
kara's the key to our salvation.
we agreed on an alliance.
you want an alliance, i see the hybrid.
leoben claims it can help me find earth.
there's no way around it.
we've tried to be patient about your model's obsession with this woman.
playing house with her on new caprica was one thing.
but this puts us all in jeopardy.
we have their raptor and their jump drive.
we don't need them.
frakkin' toaster barolay, don't.
you don't have time to figure out our jump systems without our help.
not before the other cylons get back.
and if we do figure it out in time, do we just keep running?
how long before we run out of fuel, food, ammunition?
how long before cavil's forces hunt us down?
like it or not, we have to work with the colonials.
that means kara sees the hybrid.
or you can kiss your asses good-bye.
looks as if we have no choice.
but first, we do this.
okay, we can do this.
we can give their ship jump capability again by slaving its drives to our raptor's spin sync generator.
so just do it.
their hybrid was damaged in the attack, so we're gonna have to pull her offline and execute jumps from the raptor.
pull the hybrid offline?
absolutely not.
it's never been done on an operational ship. it would be like blinding her.
kill her.
do this before the other cylons come back, we're all dead anyway.
make it happen, lt.
barolay, and strip the cables out of them.
you got it, lieutenant.
and, six, i'm gonna need some data cabling right away.
single mode, 1310, otherwise you'll blow our system to shreds.
we started the interface.
take me to this hybrid.
anders, you're on me.
might be better if i stay here.
i know more about the raptor's system than they do.
what the hell are you looking at? i know you.
you were on new caprica.
you were part of the resistance.
you killed me.
watched me drown, kicking and thrashing like i was some kind of an insect.
be happy to put you down again.
i'm okay.
barolay?
jean.
jean! you killed her.
you frakkin' killed her! you want to know what it feels like to die? you're nothing!
you're a frakkin' machine!
sam, put the gun down now! sam, stop!
what do you want me to do, kara?
you want me to forget about barolay?
you want me to forget about new caprica?
no frakkin' way! she just killed barolay!
sam! put the gun down.
put it down.
look into it.
sam.
sam, you have no idea what's at stake here.
look at me. put it down.
they killed one of us and you're just ready to let it slide?
she's right.
you can't let this go, kara.
if you don't want to do this, i will.
put the gun down, soldier.
i need to see the hybrid.
why, sister?
i just couldn't let it go.
on new caprica she was the one?
i never did anything to her. we were working at the water treatment plant and she just i know.
i remember.
after you downloaded, we tried to work through this.
how do you work through something like that? never forget her expression as i tried to scream.
just just slapped tape over my mouth and threw me in that septic tank.
you shut your frakkin' mouth.
i still see her face when i try and sleep.
we were trying to help those people.
i know.
i know.
i wish there was something i could do.
then i'm glad it's you.
gods damn it!
no resurrection ship.
you understand? she's just as dead as your friend.
is that enough human justice for you?
blood for blood?
madam president.
i wanted to apologize for before.
i have good moments and bad.
and that was which?
come in here.
i have something for you.
for me? yes, yes, come in.
come in.
all right.
would you get it?
it's in the first drawer.
right here.
that's it, yes.
this is for me? i hope it's not too gaudy.
this is beautiful.
thank you. that's beautiful.
a woman on aurora makes 'em.
leslie starus.
she makes all kinds if you want to check it out.
now, i think this one will be just fine.
what color are you ho for?
when it grows back in?
well i was thinking maybe blue.
nice royal blue.
change of pace.
my hair used to be now look at it.
feel it, feel it.
it's gonna get a lot worse.
be prepared for that.
because he will take our hands and guide us to the other side of the river.

ftl sync fault uncorrected.
no ceremonies are necessary.
for what it's worth, i voted for you in the last election.
and i don't like how baltar keeps ragging on you.
but that is not why i listen to him.
why do you listen to him?
i had an experience that made me rethink all my preconceptions.
what kind of experience? it happened the night after cottle told me that my cancer had spread to my liver and i'd never be leaving this place.
i was on a ferry, crossing a river, and as we were approaching the other side, i saw all these people standing on the bank.
and we got closer, and i recognized them.
my parents.
my sister kathy, who died when i was 12. my husband, my girls.
i was scared for a moment.
you know, how is this happening?
but then i felt it.
this presence hovering all around me. warm, loving, and it said don't be scared, emily.
i'm with you.
hold my hand and we'll cross over together.
but a lot of people in our predicament have dreams like that, emily.
no.
i was there.
i felt the cool breeze coming from the water.
the spray from the bow.
maybe he's stumbled onto something.
you know, he talks about the river that separates our world from the next.
that there's more to this existence than we can see with our naked eye.
there's a power that we can't begin to understand.
then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance.
structural integrity of node seven restored.

the children of the one reborn shall find their own country.

what do you want from me? please, i need you.
thus will it come to pass. the dying leader will know the truth of the opera house.
the missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the 13th.
you are the harbinger of death, kara thrace.
you will lead them all to their end.
end of line.
but this god that baltar refers to, it is the cylon god.
you know that, don't you? if he's the one and true god, he belongs to all of us.
otherwise, he's not much of a god, is he? exactly, he isn't much of a god.
he's a fantasy.
oh, laura.
and the lords of kobol are real.
reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop in those silly outfits.
zeus handing out fates out of an urn like like they were lottery tickets.
you're gonna work on a tylium ship.
you're gonna be an admiral.
your family's gonna be evaporated in an attack on the colonies, but you'll survive for three more years in a moldy compartment on a freighter till your body starts to eat itself up alive.
those are the gods that you worship?
capricious, vindictive.
but they're not meant to be taken literally.
they're metaphors, emily.
i don't need metaphors.
i need answers.
you're like my mother.
she wasn't satisfied with metaphors either.
she was convinced that aphrodite herself was gonna swoop her away when she died, and she believed it.
even after the doloxan and the radiation failed to stop her cancer.
she was a teacher.
she was a she was something to behold in at the head of a classroom.
and her students her students loved her.
they they'd walk through fire for her. and then you see this woman who seemed so eternal, she withered away, and i find myself having to change her diaper because she couldn't even and at the moment she died, there was no gleaming fields of elysium stretched out before her.
there was this dark black abyss.
and she was just terrified.
she was so scared.
i'm sorry.
laura.
laura.
you were terrified.
you saw only darkness.
you can't possibly know what your mother experienced.
you're you're still searching.
you're doc cottle!
doc! do something!
nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
it's okay.
it's all right.
all we can do for her now is try to make her comfortable.
that's all?
i'm sorry, that's it.
all right.
it's as if she doesn't even see us anymore.
she's looking past us.
i've seen that look many times, but never in the eyes of a cylon.
athena.
you were right.
forgive me.
it's okay.
i'm with you.
she will lead us to the end.
we will now know the truth of the opera house.
the home of the 13th.
what? the hybrid said, the missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the 13th.
the home of the 13th tribe of humans and the five is your final five cylon models.
and if they've come from the home of the 13th tribe, they must know the way back.
they know how to get to earth.
and the missing three is the model you boxed for looking at the faces of the five.
d'anna.
she can recognize 'em.
let's go.
demetrius is waiting for us.
we're here.
mother.
you're okay.
i'm not ready.
you no longer need to fear the unknown.
because he will take your hand and guide you to the other side of the river.
what river am i talking about?
i'm talking about the river that separates this world from the next.
there is more to reality than the things that we can touch, taste, or even see with our naked eyes.
there is another realm.

mission accomplished.
then let's go home.
i need to talk to you.
certainly.
come in.
thank you. can i get you some water?
yes.
you really believe that there's something in this horse manure that baltar's peddling?
i don't know.
something is happening here, and i don't really understand it, bill.
you both had the same dream, means what?
talk to me.
what's going on?
kara comes back from the dead.
i let her go off chasing her vision of earth.
well, she's overdue.
lee turns in his wings.
and helo, athena, gaeta.
will i ever see those kids again?
bill.
look at me. i'm right here.
right here.
we're going to find it.
earth?
together.
i used to think it was such a pipe dream.
i used to use it as a carrot for the fleet.
what made you change?
you.
you made me believe.
previously on battlestar galactica.
twenty-four ships jumped away.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
they're gonna follow roslin to kobol to their death.
cally shot sharon!
there are many copies.
you'll see her again.
one of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
we have found kobol, and when we retrieve the arrow, we will open the tomb of athena,,, and we will find the road to earth.
what i need to know is exactly how to find the tomb of athena.
i can show you the path.
i don't know how long the path is, or exactly where it leads to but i can tell you that you're gonna have to move very, very quickly.
i want to see all recon material on kobol immediately in my quarters.
kobol?
i'm putting the fleet back together.
i'm putting our family back together again.
the scriptures say some of us will die on kobol.
like a certain capt.
apollo?
she could be anywhere.
if we only use information contained within the book of pythia which makes sense, given the president's identification with that particular gospel then the tomb of athena is most likely located somewhere in the mountains to the west of the city of the gods.
let's assume she starts at the most easily recognized landmark which is the opera house.
they'd be setting down somewhere right here in this meadow then heading west.
are you okay? yes.
i am.
we got to get out of this ravine.
i don't want us to get caught in a flash flood.
raptor one went down right about here just outside the ruins of the city.
now we never made it past, say, here.
but we visually scouted the approaches out to the mountains.
thanks.
any time.
if this is all she's got to go on i don't know how the hell that woman thinks she's gonna find this tomb.
well, maybe she's seen it in a vision.
i'm serious.
she says she sees things.
images, prophecies, whatever.
the point is that she believes in them and so do the people that are with her.
sir, with all due respect, that terrain is so rugged i can't imagine navigating it without a map or a guide.
okay.
king of the hill.
queen of the hill, thank you very much.
we should take shelter until the storm passes.
sounds good.
after that? then we start the tough part.
let's go! the last rescue team reported no sign of a cylon baseship or a raider anywhere near kobol.
we'll set the jump arrival coordinates in the upper atmosphere just in case.
sir, that's risky and it's certainly not possible with a ship of this size.
i'll be going down in a raptor.
what?
i'm not gonna leave the fleet undefended and it's too risky to try and take all of us.
send a search party, for frak's sake.
and zeus warned the leaders of the 2 tribes that any return to kobol would exact a price in blood.
tyrol it certainly did for us.
no more bloodshed, enough loss.
i'm only gonna take people who are absolutely necessary.
don't try and argue with me, saul.
truth is i'm the only one that can reach out to roslin.
it's always been between us anyway.
we may have gone down separately, but we're gonna come back together.
hopefully on our feet.
but even in body bags we're gonna be coming back together.
i'm gonna contact the astral queen, see if they can pick us up until the weather clears.
you're not in charge here, tom.
all com traffic goes through me.
try to remember that.
how much longer do you want to wait, tom? just keep your eyes on him.
boomer there's a formation of twin rocks up ahead.
yeah, i got it.
i think those are the gates of hera.
you think?
i'm putting together a lot of pieces from a lot of sources beyond your scriptures.
if i'm right that's the spot where your god supposedly stood and watched athena throw herself down onto the rocks below out of despair over the exodus of the 13 tribes.
supposedly?
i thought the cylons believed in the gods.
yeah, don't get her started.
they believe in one true god or something like that.
and we don't worship false idols.
you were quick enough to come on this mission.
lead us all to some tomb only actually mentioned in our false scriptures.
we know more about your religion than you do.
athena's tomb, whoever whatever she really was, is probably up there.
that part is true.
madam president, we won't make it up there before nightfall.
let's go, see how far we get.
baltar this is a depressing place.
a part of me is glad sharon never made it in here.
you decided to brighten up the place a little, did you?
our child will be born here.
in this room.
you're not listening.
oh, you noticed?
no, i have had enough.
do you seriously expect me to listen to you while you sit around stark naked?
prattle on about this mythical baby of ours?
mythical?
yes, mythical.
do you have any notion of how ridiculous you've become? the whole turn of our conversation is completely shot to pieces.
i'm the father of a baby who'll be born to me from my fantasy woman who i see solely in my head.
my fantasy woman, by the way, who stopped being my fantasy.
you're not my fantasy anymore.
no, sadly now you're nothing more than a common tease.
i never said i would bear the child.
wonderful!
more doubletalk.
more mind games.
all right, then who is it gonna be? who's going to bear our secret love child?
it's not starbuck, is it?
careful, gaius, you're in dangerous territory now.
then i guess i'm really scared.
so, what's it going to be this week?
what is it?
don't tell me, i'll guess.
the ship's gonna blow up! no, damn! done that one.
so it's gotta be someone else.
someone.
me! but, of course, me! i'm gonna explode!
god! god is gonna make me spontaneously combust into a great big ball of flame and then the whole crew of galactica can celebrate on ambrosia.
get really drunk.
okay.
enough, i can't do this anymore.
you're right.
game's over you win.
i win? what did i win? you don't get it?
come on, gaius, wake up and smell the psychosis already.
i'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about.
okay.
look there's no cylon chip implanted in your brain.
i'm not real.
you're not really getting secret messages from the cylons.
you're just crazy.
very funny.
hysterical.
do you write your own material?
you don't believe me, do you?
no, i don't.
that's great!
i love it.
is it?
good.
i've had enough of this, all right?
so can we just stop playing this stupid game? i'm sorry.
but it's the truth.
there is no chip.
if there is no chip then who or what are you exactly?
i'm you.
i'm your subconscious frakking with your mind.
okay, check it out.
you helped the cylons commit genocide against your own people and your fragile little mind couldn't handle it.
so, poof! i appear and start telling you how special you are.
how god has chosen you.
yeah, right!
well, i don't know what game you're playing anymore.
but i'm not playing this stupid game, sara.
now you've had your fun.
why don't you get yourself checked out? go down to sickbay and get a brain scan.
that would settle it, wouldn't it?
go ahead.
i dare you.
tyrol how simple could it be?
okay, we're in the north-northwest continent.
quadrant c, sector two, which.
oh, for frak's sake let me see if i can make heads or tails of it.
look, i marked the terrain as best i could, but we're not.
topography's for pansies anyways.
how're you feeling?
diplomatic?
i still don't think this is a very good idea, commander.
the last time she saw me she wasn't too happy with me.
she trusts you.
values your counsel.
she'll listen to you.
i doubt that very much.
i'm her assistant.
she doesn't put any more stock than what i say-- she thinks you'll be president one day.
excuse me? that's what she said to me once.
that you reminded her of president adar when he ran for his first office.
i don't really know how to respond to that, sir.
don't let it go to your head.
adar was a moron.
racetrack this is an intra-atmos entry.
you guys buckled in? yeah.
perimeter's clear!
no cylon presence!
see? nothing to worry about.
having good luck already.
gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her. he loves her.
and, yeah, he knows she's a machine.
he doesn't care. he loves her anyway.
frak.
how can one of us get that roped in by one of them?
we should keep an eye on him, too.
helo's a friend of mine, all right.
he's one of the good guys.
yeah?
sharon was a friend of yours, too.
feel like i'm back on caprica.
no, thanks.
i'm happy right here.
really?
yeah, actually.
just being with you and kara feels like i've come home.
it's like i'm back in the fleet.
but you were never in the fleet.
that was the other sharon.
i know.
i know that.
but i remember all of it.
like getting my wings.
my first trip aboard the galactica, you know, the memory of being in a uniform is so strong, so potent it's like, i'm sharon valerii and this is my family.
that's pretty weird, huh? it's okay.
i like weird.
zarak losing that priest really frakked her up.
she's lost a lot of people.
friends, supporters.
all she has left is her young prince.
we're here.
he's here.
we know what we have to do.
terrain's rougher than we thought.
don't know how far until we reach this tomb.
why are you backing out of this now?
i'm not backing out of anything.
getting blood on your hands is a lot harder than washing it off.
then let the cylon do it.
what if the cylon were to get a weapon and shoot him herself?
there'll be a lot of confusion, stress, panic.
then the cylon could find herself getting shot real easy.
and how would you propose such a thing might happen?
this has to happen, tom.
you know that.
not until we find the tomb.
helo how much further?
farther.
what?
farther describes actual distance, further is more figurative.
you're a dictionary now? i'm sorry i'm smarter than you.
that's okay.
the baby can have your brains as long as he gets my looks.
yeah, that'd be a real blessing for her.
her? you know it's a girl?
yeah.
starbuck so from what i could tell the cylons have a plan for caprica.
they're cleaning up the bodies bringing in the heavy machinery to fix the infrastructure.
i understand.
starbuck but they haven't killed everyone.
there's a resistance movement.
once we find the tomb and get the map, i think our first order of business has to be planning a rescue mission back to caprica.
lieutenant, i hope you know how grateful i am for everything you've done and what you risked but right now i can't think about anything but finding that tomb.
thank you. comfy?
can't talk.
can't move.
then you certainly wouldn't want me to do this.
oh for.
i told you not to move.
i'm so terribly sorry, doctor.
it won't happen again.
all right.
now i have to reset and start from the beginning.
now he's got to reset and start all over again.
why are you doing this to me? no.
come on, gaius, even back when you weren't nuts there was always that little voice in your head.
that little voice hel you through the rough times, remember?
i'm just the latest version of that little voice.
i don't believe that for one moment.
no, god has a plan for me.
god's plan?
no.
okay.
yeah, god has a plan and there is a god and he talks to gaius baltar.
okay.
shut up will you!
will you stop going crazy in there?
i'm not crazy.
once you find this tomb, you know he's gonna have you killed, right?
he's not like that.
he's a soldier, you're the enemy.
nothing's gonna change that.
your twin, your copy or whatever-- i know.
the other sharon shot the old man.
i've heard it about a thousand times.
do you remember shooting him? it wasn't me.
do you remember?
no.
i see.
what do you think happened to her? i don't know.
probably threw her in the brig or something.
she was murdered by one of the crew.
and everyone aboard galactica just let it happen.
think i'm lying?
ask lee.
they're not gonna let your child be born.
you think they're gonna let you raise a potential enemy right in their midst?
you want to get off this planet alive, you better start looking out for yourself.
starbuck.
helo.
put down your weapon, captain.
commander.
it's good to see you.
madam president.
billy.
billy, you have no idea what it means to me to have you here.
it's good to see you, too.
oh, my gods.
commander!
she's with us, commander.
why? commander, no! get off her. i want you to die.
commander, please don't.
we need her.
commander, you got to let her go.
die.
sir!   dad? and you ask why.
nothing, nothing, more nothing.
are you satisfied?
yes, i am.
thank you very much, doctor.
just.
we're absolutely positive, aren't we, that there's no unidentified objects?
you can obsess over these as much as you like on your own time.
freaking hypochondriac.
one on every bloody ship.
you interfered with a military mission and you broke your word to me.
it's the second part that really bothers you, isn't it?
laura, i forgive you.
thank you, bill.
i didn't ask for your forgiveness.
you have it anyway.
i can't believe the old man reacted like that.
you know they killed the other sharon?
what? in cold blood, not even a trial.
hi.
hi.
sharon?
hello, chief.
you know who i am? yes.
we haven't met but i remember you.
it's good to see you.
so where does this leave us? back to where we started.
under the yoke of president roslin and commander adama.
not if we go back to the ship with a map to earth.
and a sad story of how many people were killed down on kobol by the cylons.
it's over.
let it go for now.
lieutenant thrace says that there are survivors back on the colonies.
there are people fighting against the cylons every day.
they're fighting for their homes, their future.
i see.
doesn't give you pause?
maybe your impulse the day the cylons attacked was right.
maybe we should've stayed and fought for our homes.
maybe the president of the colonies should've stayed with her people.
i didn't come here for this.
i didn't come here to navel-gaze or to catalog our mistakes.
we made a decision to leave the colonies after the attack.
we made that decision.
it was the right one then, it's the right one now.
so every moment of every day since then is a gift.
from the gods?
no.
from you. for convincing me that i should go.
i would be dead.
my son would be dead.
whatever else the costs i won't second-guess that outcome.
maybe it's time to go find this tomb of yours.
so cally kills sharon and the old man gives her thirty days for murder.
they don't see it as murder, helo.
that's what i'm trying to tell you.
that's what you're not hearing.
to him, to the president, to all of them cylons aren't people.
i'm not a person to them i'm a thing.
i won't just stand by and let them kill you like the other sharon.
okay?
i believe you, helo.
i do.
but if we're gonna have any future together any at all i'm gonna have to take matters into my own hands.
what're you talking about?
do you love me? yes.
do you trust me?
yes.
then don't ask me what i have to do.
sharon, what the frak are you-- trust me.
trust us.
have you had a chance to think about our conversation?
haven't thought about anything else.
and? when we get to the entrance, they'll be distracted.
i'll take the father and you take the son.
you should see this! lieutenant thrace, i hope you have that arrow handy.
i need you to know something.
i'm sharon but i'm a different sharon.
i know who i am.
i don't have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated.
i make my own choices.
i make my own decisions and i need you to know that this is my choice.
this is one of the old stallions.
it's not military issue.
where the hell did you get this?
it's his.
take it easy.
just wanted to see you get your due.
you never did listen to me.
stupid frakking thing couldn't come with a handbook.
no, because that would just be too logical, wouldn't it?
and the arrow of apollo will open the tomb of athena.
yeah, well, unless anyone sees a keyhole, or whatever then we're either in the wrong place or we're just perfectly screwed.
okay, then why don't we just.
helo, come here.
on three.
one, two, three!
there it is.
oh, my god.
after you.
helo, you stay out.
yes, sir.
chief?
sir.
everybody.
yes, sir.
if the arrow didn't actually open the tomb how do we know this is the right place?
we don't.
but it's a tomb all right.
the scriptures say you need the arrow to find the map.
starbuck these broken statues, i recognize them.
the ram, aerilon.
gemenon, the twins.
these are the icons of the 12 tribes, the 2 colonies.
this is really where it all began.
we all came from this place.
this could be picon, the fish.
i guess, this little lady could be virgon, right? the goat, caprica.
sagittaron the archer.
he's missing something.
where the hell are we?
i don't know.
tomb of athena, i think.
i thought we were already in the tomb.
i think that was the lobby.
again the ancient symbols.
these patterns were on the original flags of the 12 colonies back in the days when the colonies were called by their ancient names: aries.
taurus.
gemini.
cancer.
leo.
libra.
virgo.
the jewels match the constellations.
this is the map.
this is the map to earth.
maybe.
so is earth in one of these constellations?
we're standing on it.
we're standing on earth.
the scriptures say that when the 13th tribe landed on earth they looked up into the heavens and they saw their 12 brothers.
earth is the place where you can look up in the sky and see the constellations of the 12 colonies.
i don't know what good it's gonna do us though.
then what are we supposed to do? search the entire galaxy for one particular star pattern?
there.
there in scorpio.
i've seen that before.
it's the lagoon nebula.
astro body m8.
that's a long way from here.
yeah.
but at least now we have a map and a direction.
we have struggled since the attacks,,, trying to rely on one another, our strength, and our only hope as a people,,, is to remain undivided, we haven't always done all we could to ensure that, many people believe that the scriptures,,, the letters from the gods,,, will lead us to salvation, maybe they will, but the gods shall lift those who lift each other,  and so, to lift all of us,,, iet me present once again,,, the president of the colonies, laura roslin, thank you,  i'm okay, i'm okay, really, yeah?
it's just,,,, i don't want our baby born in this cell, their child?
i told you a child would arrive.
told you it would be born right here in this room.
how could you ever doubt me? boomer is going to bear our child?
an honor for which she is hardly deserving but one doesn't question god's will.
well, you're not a chip.
that we've established.
yes.
sharon being pregnant does suggest that you are rather more than a simple manifestation of my subconscious.
i'm not.
crazy?
no. and who or what are you exactly?
i'm an angel of god sent here to protect you. to guide you, to love you. to what end? to the end of the human race.
twelve cylon models seven are known four live in secre one will be revealed previously on battlestar galactica i'm ving you a ship.
now go.
find a way to earth.
kara,i'm alone.
this is not an attack.
i knew i'd find you.
leoben?
i'm here to offer a truce between human and cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
the hybrid.
you need to go to her,kara.
she'll tell you the way to get to earth.
we're done here.
get him out of here.
we're ready to jump back to the fleet on your o. er we're not going back to the fleet.
captain thrace,as xo of the demetrius, i'm hereby relieving you of command.
you son of a bitch.
gaeta,abort the jump!
i'm gonna take leoben back to the baseship, see if his story checks out.
we'll be waiting here till the clock runs out.
looks ke hwasn't lying about a civil war.
this is it.
the comet.
it's the ship!
thus will it come to pass.
you are the harbinger of death,kara thrace.
you will lead them all to their end.
cylon baseship.
demetrius,athena.
the baseship is ours.
then let's go home.
now i have learned from unimpeachable sources that president laura roslin has for some time now been sharing hallucinogenic visions with two cylons within our fleet: one sharon agathon,sent on the classified demetrius mission, and the other a cylon prisoner being held aboard the galac it's not that easy,madam president.
no?you should it sometime.
most of the population has heard that broadcast.
i would assume that's the point.
look,i take no pleasure in putting this before you. in fact,they practically had to push me through that door.
well,i'm sure you're quite happy to stay.
i can't put one foot in front of another without someone blocking my path asking me what the hell is going on! for the welfare of the fleet excuse me.
as long as i am in this office, the welfare of this fleet is not something you need to worry about.
you owe the people a response.
i owe the people?
that's what i believe.
what if suddenly all your beliefs were called into question?
madam president up is down.
black is white.
scripture is fiction.
home is thin air instead of solid ground,etcetera.
you know,i'm really sorry for everything you've had to endure.
i really am. but the people,they deserve a response.
do they? is there any truth to this broadcast?
and what would you do if i told you the truth?
what if it were you instead of me and all that's left of humanity has just been told that you are sharing visions with the enemy?
what would you do,mr.
adama?
would you think that the gods were testing you? so baltar is telling the truth? is it true?
yes.
demetrius reports their sys ops will be synced with ours in five minutes.
when you came knocking with that raider and asked for our help, you gave away the future of all the cylons aboard this ship.
you know that,right?
i gave it to the right person.
save it.
no guarantees.
when we meet up with the colonial fleet, i don't know if they'll feed you or frak you,all right?
since you've been calling the plays up till now, i'm assuming you're doing the talking.
good.
gods help us.
sys ops of both vessels are synced.
we're as ready as we're ever gonna be.
good.
tell the demetrius to set the board to green.
unless both ships jump in together,galactica will blow us out of the sky.
demetrius,athena.
set your board to green.
athena,demetrius.
starting to green.
let's run the horn,guys.
sublight.
go.
helm.
go.
tactical.
go.
nav.
go.
ftl.
spun up.
go.
athena,demetrius.
board is green.
i was just thinking how beautiful she must be.
your daughter,hera.
how do you know her name?
we all know her name.
you were blessed.
all right,everyone.
let's go home.
demetrius,athena.
execute jump.
clock is running.
sir,we had a problem with the sync points and the jump coordinates.
it'll take a few minutes to spool up the ftl drive again.
gods damn it!
all hands.
battle stations!
set condition one throughout the fleet!
launch alert five.
get me some more frakkin' birds in the air!
gun batteries stand by for target bearing!
demetrius,athena.
report.
demetrius,athena.
report.
baseship bearing 3-3-3 carom 4-9-8 at 15 msu.
frakkin' thing is sitting right on top of us.
mr.
hoshi,order the fleet to make an emergency jump!
all colonial vessels jump immediately to emergency rendezvous coordinates.
sir,the president's shuttle is en route.
tell them to land on landing bay 1. checkers green.
galactica,athena.
last jump must've cooked the wireless.
we've got no com.
they can't hear us.
frak.
galactica's scrambling vipers.
they're going to shoot us down.
what the frak?
eight vipers inbound.
entering  range.
where the hell is the demetrius?
baseship targeted.
weapons free.
something isn't right.
gunnery reporting.
solution correct.
main battery standing by to fire on your command.
on my command.
3,2,1.
weapons hold!
dradis contact!
galactica,demetrius,do not fire.
baseship is disarmed and under colonial command.
officers aboard.
demetrius,galactica. authenticate.
galactica,demetrius. i authenticate.
bravo,tango,8.
do not fire.
starbuck and athena have control of the baseship.
in search of a home called earth colonel,they're with me.
they're with you? so which one them shot gaeta?
lieutenant gaeta,stay with us.
all right,everybody.
stand back.
and get a cut down tray in here right now.
we became divided according to models.
the twos,eights,and sixes have come to believe that our destiny lies in seeking out the final five. the ones,fours,and fives violently opposed such action.
we know that there are seven different models of cylons.
you only mentioned six. the 3s. the d'annas.
they were boxed after the battle on the algae planet.
boxed?
her entire line was punitively deactivated.
her consciousness placed in a boxing facility.
why? d'anna saw the faces of the final five,which was forbidden.
but if we unbox her,she can reveal their identities to us. the final five have been to earth.
if we help find them,they can help us get there.
our ship can heal itself.
but most of our raiders were destroyed in the ambush.
we're asking for your help here.
we can't do it alone.
what could possibly motivate us to trust you now? what have you got? the boxing facility resides within the cylon resurrection hub.
this hub controls the functions of every resurrection ship in existence.
it protects itself by periodically jum to a new set of coordinates and then relaying them back to the baseship.
madam president,you asked for a reason to help us.
vengeance.
you destroy the hub,cylons lose their ability to download.
all of us.
why would you be willing to lose your ability to resurrect?
we're rebels.
we can't go back.
what matters most to us is being with the five.
d'anna will be able to identify them.
we'll take you to the hub if you help us unbox d'anna.
give us the coordinates of the hub first.
no,i won't do that.
i said we would take you there.
take her out.
we're finished.
wait. is your word good,admiral?
i'll give you the coordinates.
but i want your word.
stand down.
you have my word.
once their identities are revealed and we come back here, we'll be free to leave your fleet with the five.
yes.
they're here with you. the final five are in your fleet.
that's why our raiders turned back the attack in the nebula.
the weapons hold.
how the frak did you see that? to be absolutely honest with you,bill,i didn't.
what can i say?we got lucky.
well,let's get a raptor up to those coordinates that that cylon gave us.
maybe we can get lucky again.
sir.
tigh.
thank you. lords of kobal,shield your eyes.
get it with the gun camera.
hit override.
kinda pretty,isn't it?
tell it to the fleet.
no.
no.
don't put me under.
please.
just just numb everything.
felix.
just do it.
i- i don't want to wake up i don't want to wake up with my leg gone.
okay,son.
if we go in on our own horse,we won't last five minutes.
but we go in with that baseship parked out there, nobody's gonna notice us for awhile.
what do we fight with?their raiders are frakked.
we don't use theirs.
we use ours.
take half the viper wing.
half the wing?
yeah.
we'll sneak them in on the rebel baseship.
hoshi did some calculations from racetrack's photos.
we take out the ftl and the hub's stranded.
we blow the hub and,uh,billions of skin jobs lose their bath privileges.
imagine.
once they're gone,they can't come back.
mortal enemies.
before we blow the hub,we need to get a team in to unbox d'anna.
well,now,maybe we just don't.
maybe we just forget the gods damn boxing facility.
lie to the rebels.
well,they're lying to us. the skin jobs said their raiders won't fight because the final five is here?
we tangled with those slit-eyed black bastards for three years now, and they haven't turned back before.
why now? what if they're telling the truth?
what if the final five are here?
the five could know the way to earth.
if they knew,they're not gonna lead us there after we've just destroyed their resurrection capacity.
maybe they're different,like the rebels.
what if they're not?
what if their sole purpose is to destroy us? i say we blow the whole gods damn thing to dust lock,stock,and barrel and trust the president's vision, her scriptures,her way to earth.
why don't we split the difference?
unbox d'anna and find the five.
keep the five till we get to earth.
turn them over to the rebels.
they've waited this long.
it'll be on our terms.
it's all pie in the sky,gentlemen,until we know what's true and what's not.
and we put a lid on it.
the real plan stays in this room.
if the plan gets leaked to the cylons,all bets are off.
have someone escort the rebel leader back to her baseship so she can inform her people they have a deal. in 36 hours,the colonies will unite forces with insurgent rebel cylons and their leader in an unprecedented joint military operation to destroy the cylons' ability to download into.
blah blah blah.
why weren't we consulted?
i'm sorry.
i'm in the dark as much as all of you.
you know,if they unbox the d'annas,at least we'll find out who the fifth one is.
nas en all that's gonna do is crowd the airlock a little more.
do you think they're gonna yveou a medal when they find out who you are? what about you? he sings,you know.
what?
gaeta.
whenever he feels the tingling.
whenever he feels his phantom leg.
cottle says it helps him get through it.
he sings.
good morning.
morning.
what is it about the galactica that gives you such a glow?
i come over here,it's like i'm going from one dungeon to the next.
oh,i hadn't noticed.
but thank you. you ready?
yes.
i want you to find out who's behind the shared vision rumors.
who's talking to him?
with baltar?
you're slee with him,right?
don't.
i've just been informed that you've been spotted down there enough times to be a charter member of his nymph squad.
all right.
i have come to believe in baltar's spiritual message.
i don't know how or why. it just happened.
i wish you knew how many times i wanted to tell you.
your friendship and your trust means frak.
clearly my friendship and trust mean frak.
and i don't really care if you have to spend the night on your knees praying or just on your knees.
i want a name.
i want to know who's responsible for these lies.
madam president.
laura,i am so sorry.
you have a job to do. the humans are never going to allow us to have the final five and go our own way.
are you sure of this? not entirely.
i'd rather be wrong.
but we need insurance.
trust has to begin somewhere.
not with us.
it's our ship.
when we jump,we take control of it with the centurions.
we carry out the mission as promised.
but when we return,we take hostages.
the humans on this ship stay on this ship until we have the five.
look at me. we've changed,but the humans haven't.
we've come too far to risk everything on their trust.
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man with my three wishes clutched in her hand the first that she be spared the pain that comes from a dark and  reign when she finds love may it always stay true what a way to discover such a beautiful voice,huh?
how'd you find me?
your chief of staff.
needs to be horsewhipped.
if you came down here to kiss my ass to get information,save your breath.
the quorum's considering a vote of no confidence against you.
i won't compromise the success of this operation or the safety of this fleet to indulge the neediness of 12 perpetually unhappy representatives.
i can't.
i was with them on the,uh,emergency jump.
and i saw something in the faces of the delegates.
it wasn't the anxiety from waiting. it went beyond that.
i was anxious. it was my first time.
but they they.
they were empty.
the quorum had given up.
and then it struck me that after going through the same routine so many times, it was the only way that they could cope with the uncertainty.
to presume the worst.
you felt their suffering.
now try holding their lives in balance every day.
talk to them.
you don't have to tell them everything.
i know how it works.
just talk to the quorum.
let them put a face to this joint mission.
let them hear from the cylon leader.
anything.
anything to put their fears to rest.
what's the matter?
nothing.
no,nothing.
nothing at all.
we've been lying here doing nothing.
what?
you've been lying about the president sharing visions with cylons.
that happens to be the god's honest truth.
sorry.
i can't accept what you've done.
what what i've done?
what have i? what are where's this coming from?
these rumors you've started.
i've seen what they've done to her. you seriously believe that i'm making all this up?
i am not saying i'm not capable,but why would i? six revealed it.
caprica six revealed them to me through my attorney in the last days of my trial when a guilty verdict was a certainty.
i suppose i could've gone public.
caused a stir.
and all this time,you kept quiet.
i'm not saying i'm a saint,tory.
i'm many things.
but i try not to be spiteful.
got no bloodlust to go get her.
but she's a hypocrite.
the lies.
the secret missions.
co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to keep everyone in the dark,including you.
that's rather worrying,isn't it?
so i had to speak. the truth is,no good ever comes from concealing it.
i've got a broadcast.
the first that she be spared the pain that comes from a dark and  reign when she finds love may it always stay true this i beg for the second wish i made too i didn't come here to beg or plead or apologize or to keep my job.
you know me better than that.
and i didn't come here to create sympathy by parading my illness in front of you. on the contrary,there are some that probably believe that along with my cancer and drugs, i have inoculated myself against compassion.
that is a joke.
i am here because i want to tell you face to face that i believe in this mission and what it means for our future.
i'm here to profess my trust in our new allies.
i'm here to ask you to listen.
i'm here to ask for your support.
bring her in. in our civil war,we've seen death.
we've watched our people die.
gone forever.
as terrible as it was beyond the reach of the resurrection ships, something began to change.
we could feel a sense of time,as if each moment held its own significance.
we began to realize that for our existence to hold any value,it must end. to live meaningful lives,we must die and not return.
the one human flaw that you spend your lifetimes distressing over mortality is the one thing.
well,it's the one thing that makes you whole.
i believe it was no accident that we were found by kara thrace.
it was destiny.
she asked me to leave my people,and i accepted.
no matter what the sacrifice even if it should mean my death.
thus shall it come to pass. the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
you are the harbinger of death,kara thrace.
our destiny.
our future.
begins here.
thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
take her out.
but wish no more my life you can take to have her please just one day wake to have her please alone she sleeps in the shirt of man with my three wishes clutched in her hand hera! hera.
bye-bye.
i gotta hand it to you.
if you are a cylon,that was a great plan.
dangle yet another way to earth.
throw in the hub,the final five,and the real kicker, put the final five on the fleet.
even i couldn't pass that one up.
you are having those visions,aren't you? thus shall it come to pass. the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
what did you say? thus shall it come to pass. the opera house.
the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
where did where did you hear that?
who told you that? the hybrid from the baseship before they unplugged it.
the hybrid.
how does the hybrid know what's in my dream?
i wish i knew.
this has got to stop.
these visions.
i've got to find out about these visions.
i've got to know.
will you help me?
yes.
find captain agathon.
when i spoke to the quorum,i could feel it.
the contempt.
you were right.
they're not ready to trust us.
no,i was wrong.
we're not ready.
we're deceiving them.
for protection.
for necessity.
out of suspicion and fear.
why haven't the final five come forward?
what if they're watching,judging us on our actions?
we're about to resort to violence and coercion.
what if they refuse to come with us? we can't do this.
it's too late.
we have to order the centurions to stand down.
it's too late.
they're committed.
then we have to tell the humans the truth.
no,you can't do that.
they'll never trust us again.
they already know the coordinates.
they'll just go destroy everything.
go.
stall for time.
talk to adama.
tell them anything.
anything but the truth.
i'll deal with the centurions. of course.
have a seat.
we're going to settle this now.
what's to settle?
your chief of staff is incomparably talented.
i've been sharing visions with sharon agathon and the six.
so i was only speaking the truth.
yes. the hybrid on the baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.
we're going to talk to the hybrid.
and why would you require my presence?
because you're in my visions.
what are you doin',baby? are you drawing? can i see what you drew? oh,no.
no! why? why? why? hera?
hera?
hera! raptor 1-2-4,you are cleared for landing hera! hera.
hera! have you seen my daughter?
no,i haven't.
hera! hera! hera! hera! i can't find hera.
hera! get away from my child.
get your hands off of my child.
athena.
stay back!
stay away.
stand down!
plug it in.
i need to talk to it.
let god's will be done.
shut up.
it's time to get some answers.
tyrol,will you come in here and take hera,please?
just do it,tyrol.
is she gone?
yeah.
you are never gonna take my child.
we didn't come here to.
jump! to have her please just one day wake to have her please just one day wake.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica:  adama: doral!
when this body dies, my consciousness will be transferred to another one.
the cylons have the ability to mimic human form.
they look like us now.
this man has been identified as a cylon agent.
you sleep, i watch.
no.
you're the one who needs sleep.
you were lucky that you didn't lapse into a coma.
the time is going to come when you won't be able to hide what you're going through.
laura.
roslin: yes? madam president, are you okay in there?
i'm fine, it's just the side effects from the chamalla.
roslin: you know that thing they say, what's worse? the cancer or the cure?
what do you need?
you have an urgent call from the captain of the gemenon traveller.
roslin: can i call him back?
billy: he says he found a cylon on board.
roslin: they found him in the starboard storage compartment.
roslin: looked like he'd been camped here for days.
adama: are they sure it's a cylon?
roslin: the captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out.
he's another copy of the man you knew as leoben conroy.
where is it now?
aboard the gemenon traveller, locked in a storeroom, under .
isolate that ship.
order the cap to fly escort around the gemenon traveller.
and not to approach any other ship in the fleet.
aye, sir.
kat, galactica, fly close i'll send a team over to destroy it immediately.
roslin: i want this man interrogated first.
adama: first of all it's not a him, it's an it second, anything it says cannot be trusted.
best thing to do is destroy it immediately.
i'd like to hear what this thing has to say. it might be important.
madam president, i've dealt with this model before.
adama: lt'll fill your head with doubletalk, half-baked philosophy and confuse you.
then send someone who won't be easily confused.
that's an order, commander.
roslin: i want him interrogated.
order understood.
starbuck: think it'll give me something?
adama: no.
adama: president disagrees.
you need me to go, i'll shower up and go.
how's this coming?
we got the entire avionics package figured out.
fire control, navigation and i think that i am zeroing in on her ftl drive.
i did this in a hurry about three weeks ago.
it's my after-action report on leoben.
it's a very clever machine.
manipulative, cunning.
the only problem with leoben isn't that he lies.
that would be too easy.
it's that he mixes lies with truth.
just remember, he's gonna try to get into your head.
my mum always said there was nothing in there anyway.
just be careful.
he has an agenda.
it's a goal you won't understand until later.
your job is to make sure he doesn't achieve the goal.
yes, sir.
tyrol: lieutenant.
what's up? nothing.
just wanted to see if what i told you the other day helped at all? yeah.
actually it did.
you do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually works.
tyrol: where did you come up with that anyway?
just pop into your head?
i'm a cylon.
you know, that's not even funny.
if i could prove that i wasn't would that make a difference?
you know, between us?  pilot: gemenon traveller, raptor seven-one-niner inbound with lt.
thrace aboard.
permission to dock.
man: roger, seven-one-niner.
permission granted.
captain: really does look like a person.
starbuck: yeah.
captain: must be all full of wires inside.
starbuck: no, you cut him open, there's blood, guts the whole thing.
it's sweating.
well, i'll be.
look at that.
god, they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people.
captain: why do you think they do that?
starbuck: i don't care why.
starbuck: but the fact that these things sweat now that's interesting.
starbuck: slee?
praying.
i don't think the gods answer the prayers of toasters.
god answers everyone's prayers.
how many cylons are there in the fleet?
we haven't been properly introduced.
i'm leoben.
starbuck: how many cylons in the fleet?
leoben: i have no idea.
what's your name?
how long have you been hiding aboard this ship?
am i not allowed to know your name?
starbuck: why were you hiding here?
leoben: i had a mission to perform.
listen, it's a small thing.
can you just tell me who you are? tell me about your mission and i'll think about it.
my mission was to conduct sabotage.
what kind of sabotage?
god, you stink.
can i get some air in here?
between you and the humidity.
starbuck: i am not here to play games with you.
you said you wanted to cooperate.
either start talking or we are done.
okay.
but i really wanna know your name.
starbuck: open.
are you lt.
starbuck?
yes, you are.
i knew  leoben: i was right.
i was right.
i saw it.
i've seen it.
happy now? it all makes sense now.
doesn't it?
leoben: now we can talk.
now we can talk about a lot of things.
like what? i planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships.
it's set to go off at 1830 hours.
where?
i'm not ready to give that up yet.
you're lying.
there's no warhead.
you can't take the chance, starbuck.
your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide.
maybe my training wasn't so good.
maybe i push you out the air lock, and tell them you never said a word.
now, who's lying.
these things happen for a reason, don't they?
i'm looking forward to spending more time with you.
we have a lot to talk about.
it's gonna be fun.
put the red on alert immediately.
dee? and sweep galactica for any kind of radiological devices.
right.
contact all the captains in the fleet.
adama: have them do radiological sweeps of their ships.
adama: but emphasize that this is just a precaution.
adama: i don't wanna alarm anyone until we're sure.
yes, sir.
well, we'll know for sure in hours and 40 minutes.
lt.
thrace, did he say anything else? no. he guessed my call sign.
seemed really happy when he found out who i was.
adama: he's playing with your mind.
he's been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet.
fifty ways he could've heard the word starbuck on a wireless set.
that's what i figured, sir.
roslin: any idea what he wants?
not yet.
says he's looking forward to spending some time with me, though.
don't take any chances, starbuck.
yes, sir.
you believe in the gods, don't you?
lords of kobol, and all that?
starbuck: why should i tell you? it's not a trick question.
i wanted to see how much i got right.
so you pray to artemis, aphrodite?
starbuck: where's the warhead?
i was right.
see, our faiths are similar, but i look to one god, not to many.
i don't give a damn about what you believe.
to know the face of god, is to know madness.
i see the universe.
i see the patterns.
leoben: i see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day.
it's all there.
i see it.
and you don't.
and i have a surprise for you.
i have something to tell you about the future.
starbuck: is that so? leoben: it is.
but we have to see this thing through till the end.
what is the most basic article of faith?
leoben: this is not all that we are.
the difference between you and me is, i know what that means and you don't.
i know that i'm more than this body, this consciousness.
a part of me swims in the stream.
but in truth, i'm standing on the shore.
the current never takes me downstream.
this is worse than galactica.
and i didn't think that was possible.
and what was that?
swimming in streams or something?
do you mind?
leoben: thank you.  starving.
haven't eaten in days.
kind of bad programming, isn't it?
i mean, why bother with hunger?
part of being human.
you're not human.
how's your lunch?
you know how it is.
when you're starving, anything tastes good.
did that hurt?
yeah, that hurt.
starbuck: machines shouldn't feel pain shouldn't bleed shouldn't sweat.
sweat.
that's funny.
that's good.
see, a smart cylon would turn off the old pain software about now.
but i don't think you're so smart.
maybe i'll turn it off and you won't even know.
starbuck: here's your dilemma.
turn off the pain, you feel better, but that makes you a machine, not a person.
you see, human beings can't turn off their pain.
human beings have to suffer and cry, and scream, and endure because they have no choice.
so the only way you can avoid the pain you're about to receive is by telling me exactly what i wanna know.
just like a human would.
i knew this about you.
you're everything i thought you would be.
but it won't work.
i won't tell you anything.
maybe not.
but then, you'll know deep down that i beat you that a human being beat you and that you are truly no greater than we are.
you're just a bunch of machines after all.
let the games begin.
hi.
well, look what the cat dragged in.
baltar: lt.
valerii.
it's an unexpected visit.
baltar: you look wonderful.
boomer: i need your help.
baltar: anything i can do.
anything at all.
wonder why they call her boomer?
i heard you were working on a test to tell the difference between cylons and humans.
bingo.
i can't really talk about that at the moment.
you wouldn't help settle a bet for me, would you?
baltar: why do they call you boomer?
if you're working on a cylon detector, do you think i could be in the first batch?
you know, to be tested?
what's her rush?
what's your rush?
baltar: i'm not sure it would be appropriate to show favouritism if indeed i am working on anything at all.
i saved your life back on caprica.
my co-pilot gave up his seat for you.
i brought you back to galactica, to safety.
you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me.
you owe me.
she shoots.
she scores.
baltar: i suppose there's some small truth to that.
so can you test me or not?
i think you should do it.
results will be quite intriguing.
baltar: the technology for cylon detection is not quite ready for full-scale implementation.
but i could use a beta test subject.
sharon's late.
half an hour.
i notice you're calling her sharon now.
yeah, i choose to think of her as one of them.
because you dislike her? because in the scheme of things, we are as we do.
she acts like one of them, thinks like them.
she is one of them.
but she's one of us. it would be best to remember that.
we had sex.
congratulations.
no.
6: does he love you? boomer: i think so.
no.
6: has he said it?
boomer: not directly.
then you're just guessing.
stay in your current location.
we're setting up a cabin for you nearby.
food, water, electricity.
all the comforts.
shouldn't be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together.
no.
6: if not, kill him.
can you handle that?
we made it this far, we'll make it all the way.
something happened to you, i wouldn't know how to deal with it.
caprica.
doral: if he flees, he dies.
no.
6: does he love you? helo.
helo: hey, what's going on?
boomer: come on.
we gotta go.
now.
i saw cylons.
they're heading this way.
we got to travel fast, even faster than before.
why? what's different?
everything.
just trust me.
i do.
now, if you were human you'd be just about ready to start offering up some false information about the location of the nuke.
starbuck: some tiny thing that may get you a reward and spare you some of this.
but then i keep forgetting you're not human.
starbuck: you're a machine.
i am more than you could ever imagine.
i am god.
i'm sorry.
you're god?  wow.
nice to meet you.
that's good.
we'll give you a couple of minutes with that.
it's funny, isn't it?
we're all god, starbuck.
all of us.
i see the love that binds all living things together.
love?
you don't even know what the word means.
i know that god loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid his divine love with sin with hate, corruption, evil.
so then he decided to create the cylons.
the gods had nothing to do with it.
we created you.
us. it was a stupid, fracked up decision, and we have paid for it.
you slaughtered my entire civilisation.
that is sin.
that is evil.
and you are evil.
am i? leoben: i see the truths that float past you in the stream.
starbuck: you have a real thing about rivers and streams, don't you?
i think we should indulge you in your obsession.
do you realise i could kill you before they came back in the room?
i could get to my feet rip your skull from your spinal column crash through that door kill the  in less time than it has taken me to describe it to you.
then why don't you?
it's not the time.
: he's loose!
i have a surprise for you.
you fracked up, pal.
now the gloves come off.
combat, col.
tigh.
adama: how's the search going for the nuke?
nothing so far.
adama: how much time remaining?
tigh: hours, minutes.
spread out the fleet.
no ship more than 500  from any other ship.
lf there's a nuke, let's limit the damage.
aye, sir.
no.
do it.
starbuck: leave him.
: sir?  tell me where the warhead is otherwise you're gonna drown in that bucket.
i can't drown.
i can't die.
starbuck: right.
commander adama mentioned that how if your body dies your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body.
something like that.
no, exactly like that.
see, i've been thinking.
why is a cylon willing to talk at all? why does he care if we destroy his body?
won't he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas?
starbuck: tell me where the warhead is.
this is not your path, starbuck.
you have a different destiny.
don't interrupt me.
you see, i'm gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain.
you see, i think that you're afraid.
you're afraid that we're a long way from home.
what if you don't transfer all the way back?
what if when you die here, you really die? starbuck: it's your chance to find out if you're really god or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut.
i'm not afraid of dying.
someone's programmed you with a fairytale of god, and streams, and life ever after.
but somewhere in that hard drive you call a brain is a  message: error, error.
does not compute.
i don't have a soul.
i have software.
if i die, i'm gone.
i have a soul.
i see patterns.
i know you.
you're damaged.
you were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
your life is a testament to pain.
injuries.
accidents.
some inflicted upon others, others inflicted upon yourself.
it surrounds you like a bubble.
but it's not real, it's just it's just something she put in your head.
it's something that you wanna believe because it means you're the problem, not the world that you live in.
you wanna believe it because it means that you're bad luck.
you're like a cancer that needs to be removed.
because you hear her voice every day.
and you want her to be right.
start again.
baltar: now, we just pop this in the slot and wait for the results.
green, you're a normal human being.
red, you're an evil cylon.
should take a couple of minutes.
so tell me, are you from aerilon? there's a slight trace of an accent there.
boomer: what?
no.
troy.
baltar: troy.
tell me, why is that familiar?
mining settlement.
the accident.
baltar: the .
right.
that was tragic.
baltar: your family?
boomer: they died with the rest.
i'm very sorry.
it's a lie.
congratulations, doctor.
you've just uncovered your very first cylon.
now, here's an interesting moment in the life of gaius baltar.
what will he do? is everything okay?
yeah.
yeah, i'm just interpolating the results.
the question is, what will she do if you expose her? thank you or kill you?
i thought it was just green or red.
well, it's a little more complicated than that.
she probably doesn't know.
she probably thinks she's just another girl from troy whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident.
should be interesting to see how she responds when you tell her the truth.
i'm guessing her cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret.
let's find out.
congratulations, it's green.
it's very bright green.
you're not a cylon.
really?
for a second, i was worried what you were gonna say.
baltar: were you?
boomer: yeah.
well, there's nothing to be worried about anymore.
you couldn't be more human if you tried.
well, thanks.
anytime.
i have something to tell you.
how long before this supposed bomb goes off? less than an hour.
get me a shuttle.
i'm going to the gemenon traveller.
i want to see the cylon myself.
billy: madam president, you need to roslin: don't even start.
i don't wanna discuss this.
i've made my decision.
not until i get you a security detail.
enough.
for frack's sake, let him breathe.
you're really sick.
you're not a person.
you're a machine that's enjoying its own pain.
all this has happened before.
and all of it will happen again.
don't quote scripture.
you don't have the right to use those words.
you kneel before idols and ask for guidance.
but you can't see that your destiny's already been written.
leoben: each of us plays a role.
each time, a different role.
maybe the last time, i was the interrogator and you were the prisoner.
the players change, the story remains the same.
and this time this time your role is to deliver my soul to god.
do it for me.
leoben: it's your destiny and mine.
and i told you i had a surprise for you.
are you ready?
you're gonna find kobol.
birthplace of us all.
kobol will lead you to earth.
this is my gift to you, kara.
roslin: what the hell is going on here?
what exactly is it that you are doing here?
it's a machine, sir.
there's no limit to the tactics i can use.
and where's the warhead?
starbuck: i don't know.
roslin: you don't know?
roslin: you spent the last eight hours torturing this man.
this machine.
roslin: whatever it is.
and you don't have a single piece of information to show for it.
he thinks he can see the future.
says he knows our destiny, our fate.
he says we're gonna find kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to earth.
clean him up.
there's not much time.
yes, sir.
roslin: do you know who i am? leoben: yes.
i apologise for what you've been through.
roslin: take his restraints off.
do it.
thank you. i can do more.
i can guarantee your safety.
i can order your release.
we are running out of time.
we have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off.
roslin: i've come here to tell you that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue.
it can stop right here with us.
we have to trust each other.
trust me.
roslin: i think you know you can.
tell me what i need to know, and you will live.
the warhead doesn't exist.
i made it up.
lieutenant was right.
i was too far out.
i didn't wanna die, so when i got caught, i made up a story to buy some time.
i see.
thank you for the truth.
leoben: thank you, madam president.
don't be too hard on kara.
she was just doing her job.
the military they teach you to dehumanise people.
i'll take that into consideration.
no, stand down.
laura, i have something to tell you.
adama is a cylon.
yeah.
are you all right?
i'm fine.
the bomb?
nothing.
put him out the airlock.
what?
you can't do that.
not after he told you yes, i can. and i will.
lieutenant, look at me. you've lost perspective.
during the time i have allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship he has caused our entire fleet to spread out defenceless. he puts insidious ideas in our minds.
more lethal than any warhead.
he creates fear.
but you're right.
he's a machine and you don't keep a deadly machine around.
when it kills your people and threatens your future you get rid of it.
he's not afraid to die.
he's just afraid that his soul won't make it to god.
lords of kobol, hear my prayer.
i don't know if he had a soul or not.
but if he did, take care of it.
hell of a risk you took today.
something i had to do.
care to tell me why? president adar once said that the interesting thing about being a president is that you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
something wrong?
no.
nothing at all.
.
previously on battlestar galactica.
the refinery captain is still not cooperating.
and now, seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies.
frak this! i'm sending in the marines.
tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies.
people, step back, all right?
we're just here for the supplies.
all right?
stay out of our way, and no one gets hurt.
cease fire! cease fire! you shot people for throwing coffee.
the crowd was out of control.
somebody took a shot.
i don't know who it was.
then all hell broke loose.
it was an accident.
what do you want from me, helo?
she's a cylon.
i'm not going to let you kill her.
okay?
she's carrying my child.
i'm okay, really.
yeah.
it's just, i don't want a baby born in a cell.
people, just step back, stay back, all right?
we just need some supplies, get them back, get them back,  cease fire! cease fire!  medic, we need a medic in here, now, dad! oh, my gods!
oh, my gods!
d'anna this recently discovered footage,,, from what's become known as the gideon massacre,,, appears to show galactica's marines  indiscriminately,,, into a crowd of unarmed civilians, four dead, 12 wounded, and yet, as of today, not a single charge has been filed,,, against any of the marines involved, nor their commanding officers, this is d'anna biers, reporting, d'anna that's gonna blow this thing wide open.
we need some stock footage of raging marines.
we can intercut that with the eyewitness statements.
you've no right to come in here like this.
ma'am, you're to come with us.
what, am i under arrest?
no, ma'am.
and what if i refuse to go? hello, miss biers.
it's nice to see you.
welcome to colonial one, madam president, it's an honor.
cmdr.
adama.
where did you get the tape?
from an anonymous patriot.
so, is this a social call or are we on the verge of another coup?
funny.
just something to break the ice.
i take it i'm here because you are unhappy with my story on the gideon massacre?
what happened aboard the gideon was a tragedy.
but it was not a massacre.
but the tape shows your men  into a crowd of defenseless civilians.
my marines tell a different story.
not to me.
i've submitted a dozen interview requests, all denied.
well, that's about to change.
you've been lobbying to do a story on the galactica for months.
cmdr.
adama has agreed to give you unlimited access to his crew and his ship.
that's right.
unlimited access.
all access won't buy you a propaganda piece.
we don't want one.
miss biers, this tape of yours has put fuel on a fire that was about to die.
people are angry, they are distrustful of the military.
yeah, with good reason, ma'am. in some cases, with good reason.
but i want to show the people what life aboard the galactica is really like.
i want to put a human face on the officers and the crew who protect us against cylons and  our freedoms every day.
you might not like that face when you see it.
what would that be? all we really want is a balanced story.
show us what the men and women of galactica are really like.
that's it?
that's it.
and i need you to do it now before we tear each other apart.
the cag had better start  some heads.
half our supply runs are behind schedule.
combat, dualla.
colonel, it's your wife.
something's wrong.
colonel.
ellen, are you okay? oh, saul, gods.
oh, i'm so scared.
tigh from the darkness, you must fall.
what does it mean?
racetrack, where did you get these?
sorry, sir, they were left over from a civilian run.
i've been meaning to throw them out.
no.
adama put them in a safe place.
hold on to them.
yes, sir.
you filming this? d'anna we've been rolling since colonial one, the president did say, total access.
you'll have that.
but you start shooting anything that compromises the safety of the ship and it will be cut.
dualla that hiss you hear is an oxygen recirc unit.
we have about a dozen co2 scrubbers aboard galactica, they all work get a close-up of that, would you, bill?
yeah, sure.
we just finished a 15-hour rotation.
yeah, well, you better get used to it.
we may be short on pilots till the rest of the fleet pulls the stick out of its collective fat ass.
more fall-out from tigh's moment of glory?
you heard about his death threat?
couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
i just can't believe that i haven't been called in for questioning yet.
oh, you were top of the list.
but don't worry.
i told tigh that you wouldn't know caprican poetry if it was hot-soldered across your helmet.
from the darkness, you must fall failed and weak, to darkness all.
kataris.
not one of his best.
can i be a suspect again?
please.
dualla ship's galley is next on the itinerary.
our vegetable stores and canned goods are kept in titanium lockers to ensure maximum freshness.
i didn't come all this way to interview the soup of the day.
dualla ma'am.
there comes tweedledum and tweedledee.
guys, people are slee.
man  keep it down.
kat sorry.
man  lighten up, palladino.
hey, is that on?
are you recording?
hi, mom! miss you, mommy.
this is for my buddies on freighter 2-12! yeah, that's for you! kat! kat, you want to tell me what the hell you think you're doing?
i was just saying hi to some of my buddies on the fleet, sir.
right.
so you were literally talking out of your ass.
kind of.
go on, get dressed.
yes, sir.
castanza, get the hell out of here.
it's the last time you come into senior officers' quarters.
go.
move.
so, you must be the reporter we were expecting.
well, you didn't have to dress for me.
d'anna biers, fleet news service.
capt.
lee adama, commander of the air group, that's pronounced cag.
and i suggest you find yourselves an exit as soon as possible and that's pronounced, asap '. i think we've seen all we need to see here.
whose brilliant idea was that?
how did your family respond?
my dad went crazy when i enlisted.
he thought the military was a joke.
a refuge for emotional cripples and patriotic fools.
but you signed up anyway.
i guess i just wanted to believe in something.
you think it'll give it more memory?
yeah, it seems pretty simple.
maybe just a basic adjustment.
it's a pretty good piece.
yeah, it's kind of old.
d'anna maybe i need a new one.
what the hell is going on?
i don't know.
you don't know.
i'm the vice president.
she's supposed to be interviewing me, isn't she? well, of course she should.
your title alone commands respect. of course it does.
it's a rare commodity around here.
i mean, i'm the vice president.
i'm not going beg. i'll tell you that much.
dualla miss biers, our next stop-- now, gaius, you may have to beg.
you'll do whatever's necessary to protect our child.
politics may not be your strong suit, but it serves us in the moment.
trust me.
this one can help us.
mr.
vice president?
hello.
hi.
d'anna biers, fleet news service.
oh, you're the reporter.
that's right.
cmdr.
adama said the news service might be joining us.
i suppose you're well, very busy doing a lot of interviews, i would imagine.
well, i would love to speak to you.
if you've got a second, we can do it now.
no.
i'm afraid not.
i am very busy.
really, really busy, at the moment.
snowed under.
but if you get in touch with one of my aides, there might be a small window tomorrow.
i'm not promising anything, honestly.
but, i might be able to give you an interview then if that's what you would like.
good.
good.
well, you justcarry on.
what a strange little man.
d'anna capt.
adama i hardly recognized you with your clothes on.
look, i'm sure you thought it was clever busting into the pilot's duty locker, but the area's off-limits for a reason.
it's the one place where my people can unwind, be themselves.
you seem to think that your pilots deserve special consideration.
actually, i do.
like everyone else my pilots have lost their families, their friends everyone they ever cared about.
but on top of that, they are asked to put their lives on the line every single day for a fleet that seems more interested in what they do wrong than in what they do right.
they're not asking for your pity, but they damn well deserve your respect.
gods, chief, we've already run this up twice.
yeah, something doesn't feel right.
what?
something doesn't feel right.
well, hurry up.
that's it.
great.
oh, that's fantastic.
that's just great.
i knew it.
how did i miss that?
maybe if your knuckledraggers spent more time on maintenance and less time frakking around.
this knuckledragger just saved your ass, sir.
why don't you say that a little louder, chief?
i don't think the camera heard you.
you know what?
frak the camera.
you've been riding my don't even try defending-- for no frakking reason!
knock it off!
chief, fix the ship.
yeah, fix the-- hey! what?
hey, enough! chief, fix your ship.
you get the hell out of here, now.
get the camera out of my face.
she has been pissing me off all week.
what the hell's going on?
i'm taking her off rotation until she gets her head rewired.
i mean.
can't do it.
we need the pilots.
besides, if i scratched everyone who popped off at the chief the cooks would be flying the missions.
son of a bitch.
did you get all that?
you happy?
come on.
walk away.
we were never trained for crowd control.
first order of business when under attack is defend yourself and your squad.
but these were civilians.
i have 10 stitches that say we were under attack.
truth is, it was a command frak-up the moment tigh put us on that supply ship.
i'm not surprised someone's trying to take out that drunk son of a bitch.
all right.
private.
belay that.
col.
tigh's been threatened?
no.
this interview's over.
shut that off.
commander.
watch your step, please.
okay, come on.
sitrep.
fleet's quiet, no enemy contact for the last 10 days.
no cylon contact, anyway.
well, they have their job to do.
we have ours.
did you hear about the meeting on cloud nine?
reps flying in from every vessel in the fleet for a king-size bitch session?
yeah, i've heard.
well, they sent us an invitation to send a delegation.
you're it.
do you mind?
d'anna no, no.
go ahead.
we're in.
i'm not exactly the most popular guy in the fleet right now.
well, it'll be good then, to let your cutters know that you're not afraid of them.
that what you think?
i've been hiding?
what the hell is going on here, bill?
you've been doing this too long.
we were worried about ulterior motives.
you're going because you're not afraid and people should see that.
plus, it'll also give people a chance to vent their feelings instead of seething in private.
and finally, i think you need a little r&r.
so consider this mandatory shore leave.
take a swim.
get some sleep.
sir.
and stay away from the bar.
three.
there's three.
so, you got lots.
starbuck good luck, colonel.
have fun on cloud nine.
you bet.
initiating pre-flight, what's going on?
abort launch!
everybody out, now!  everybody back.
get back, now.
what's going on? the main bus is totaled.
looks like somebody took a hammer to it.
if this had blown in transit, the cabin would have vented to space.
someone's trying to kill you, saul.
comes with the stripes.
it's because of that damned gideon incident.
ellen, we don't know that. of course we do.
d'anna biers left two messages already.
she's giving you the chance to tell your side.
i don't have to explain myself, especially to her. roslin wants to placate the fleet put the great bill adama back on his pedestal.
the fastest way to do that is by hanging you out to dry.
why do you think adama wanted to send you to cloud nine? the gideon happened on my watch.
yes.
but you didn't order those jar-heads to open fire.
this is so like you, saul.
always the proud soldier, taking the heat because it's honorable.
when are you going to realize we're all alone out here?
d'anna are you afraid when you go into combat?
first thing they tell you is to assume you're already dead.
well, that sounds ghoulish.
yeah, maybe.
but dead men don't get scared or freeze up under fire.
me, i'm just worried that hell's going to be a lonely place and i'm gonna fill it up with every toaster son of a bitch i find.
what's been the hardest for you? they try to turn off the human part of you because that's what'll get you killed.
but when you're out in the field, it's not that easy.
nothing's that easy.
you got five minutes.
sharon?
it's me.
sharon!
give me your light.
what the hell are you talking about?
give me your light, now.
something's wrong.
oh, gods.
call dr.
cottle.
helo now!  d'anna does that help you cope with the stress?
not really.
look, all that i ever wanted was to be an officer on a battlestar, okay, i trained my whole life, trained harder than anyone in my unit basically, i put my life on hold until i was assigned to galactica, then the cylons hit and i realized that this is all that i know.
tech manuals, commands, and tactics.
you know, i'm not saying that i'm unhappy.
just wondering if there's something more.
and what have you discovered? i hate cigarettes.
ambrosia's good with a chaser.
and if you have enough ambrosia they don't really hurt that much.
there you go.
we'll make this as painless as possible.
drink? is this an interview or a cocktail party?
are you kidding? this is how we keep it painless.
just like to keep it casual, that's all.
please.
cheers, colonel.
cheers.
before we begin i had heard rumors that, that you had death threats ieveled against you. is that right?
this is a military vessel.
we have rumors for every occasion.
was it hard for you to take over your friend's command when he was shot?
i didn't take anything.
command fell to me and i did my duty.
but you were in full command of galactica for more than a week and in that time there were a number of controversial actions taken.
you're talking about the gideon, i made a military decision.
given the same circumstances, i'd do it again.
so you have no regrets, whatsoever?
you're trying to set me up! colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the gideon massacre?
please come.
get out of my face! did you get that?
got it.
someone's a mean drunk.
great.
i could use a sparring partner.
sorry.
i didn't bring my gloves.
too bad.
capt.
adama said that i could ask you about the new pilots.
yeah, well, capt.
adama likes to push my buttons.
so, what do you look for in a new recruit?
coordination.
good reflexes.
total commitment.
most of all, someone crazy enough to follow me into combat.
d'anna colonel, why do you think,,, there was no official investigation,,, into the gideon massacre?
please come, get out of my face, i want to apologize for col.
tigh's behavior.
it was uncalled for.
seems like a lot of people have been apologizing for him over the years, commander.
so level with me.
why is col.
tigh not being charged in the gideon incident?
we're at war against an enemy with a vastly superior force.
i will not sacrifice the few people we have left on the altar of public outrage.
so four civilians are dead and tigh and the shooters take a walk.
nobody takes a walk.
we all gotta live with it.
kelly viper five-niner-one galactica you are cleared into the break, portside landing bay hands-on approach.
checkers are green.
call the ball.
kat roger ball, wait a second, guys.
damn it!
speed two-zero-five.
keep your power up, kat, you're drop below glideslope.
controls are messed up.
come on, come on, come on.
still too low.
wave off, kat.
wave off! what the hell is going on? that is her third wave-off.
when we make a contact the squadron's got seconds to put it all together.
pre-flight, weapons check, communications one mistake, we're a smear in the cockpit.
i don't understand, is she trying to-- shut the frak up.
kat.
we're gonna do this, okay?
leave the throttle alone down the middle, then chop it at the come-on in close and feel for the deck.
kat the controls are messed up, i can't feel it.
i can't do it.
kat, we did this all through training, okay?
you're gonna stick this, just like before.
no, viper five-niner-one galactica, you are cleared into the break.
call the ball.
too low, five-niner-one.
wave off! no, she's putting down!
kat, full throttle now.
i can't feel it.
when you came back after a successful run.
let me tell you, it is better than a great meal.
better than hitting a jackpot.
it's better than sex.
kat i can't do it,  she missed the trap.
damage control, medics, report to portside hangar bay.
woman  medics to portside hangar bay, what the hell happened?
kat's made the trap 100 times.
yeah, i guess 101 was a real bitch, huh? kat let go of me.
let me go.
hey.
kat! it's starbuck.
you're okay.
you're home!
home?
home is dead.
we gotta get out of here, they're gonna kill us! what are these, stims?
please don't do this.
kat let go.
no! let go! let go off me! we're gonna die! starbuck get my pilot to sick bay now.
stims.
by the look of it, she's been taking them by the handful.
hey.
sharon don't you dare touch me.
cottle listen to me.
what are you doing?
listen to me.
i'm trying to save your baby.
hold her still!
this is a restricted area.
commander, she's over here.
cmdr.
adama, that woman looks just like the late lt.
valerii.
the tape, please.
why would galactica be harboring a cylon? the tape.
did the baby survive?
you understand that even a hint of this could be devastating to the morale in the fleet.
you are the master of understatement.
you know, after the gideon, this could turn the entire fleet against you.
then the real question is, whether or not it matters to you.
you know, i am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism.
we all want this fleet to survive.
i think you're doing very well.
very well, under the circumstances.
i understand this has been a difficult job for you.
i mean, i hear that your reports haven't exactly ingratiated you with the commander, have they?
or the rest of the crew, for that matter.
still, luckily, as a member of the civilian government i'm here to assure you that i have no such reservations.
i think most of the crew understands i'm just doing my job.
as are we all.
all just doing our jobs, aren't we? i'm just doing my job.
you're just doing your job.
okay.
cut to the chase, gaius.
tell her why you deserve to lead this fleet.
as i myself discovered, when i was stranded stranded on kobol i found that the stress of survival revealed ieadership qualities that previously i didn't even know that i possessed.
really.
yeah?
i understand your party took several casualties.
yes.
that was very unfortunate.
they were heroes, every one.
you know what, i'm ready.
shall we shoot this one?
oh, it's probably just a false alarm.
ignore it.
you're okay.
bill, you take the hangar deck.
i'm gonna take the clc.
go.
please.
you're as safe as houses down here.
really.
man  incoming cylon raiders, this is not a drill, repeat, that's showbiz.
what have we got? two raiders, closing fast.
sir, the cylon raiders are on cbdr with galactica, speed two-two-point-seven-niner. dualla, what's cbdr?

the last time we talked, it got heated.
i told him i never wanted to see him again.
three weeks later, the cylons attacked.
okay, so i'm new at this. should i be scared?
i am.

gaeta, you have the deck.
yes, sir.
set condition throughout the ship.
repeat, set condition 3, does this ever get any easier?
no, ma'am.
it gets harder.
thank you. was 15 degrees?
sixteen.
so, how'd it go out there? well, we didn't lose anyone.
that's a good day.
ellen?
i'm not sure i've found a story in all this yet.
go back a bit.
yeah.
there.
i know that book.
that's by kataris.
what's wrong, colonel?
need a drink?
you can go to hell.
i've been there.
it was called gideon, i can't eat.
i can't sleep.
i see their faces.
those weren't cylons we attacked, those were real people.
they looked like my dad.
they looked like my little brother.
this isn't gonna change anything.
at least the people on the gideon will have their justice.
if that's what this is about, then do it.
i will.
i'll do it.
somebody has to pay for what happened on that ship.
i was in command, i sent you there, it's my fault.
come on, son.
do it.
gideon was an accident.
this is a choice.
colonel.
we're all right here.
let's go, lieutenant.
would you get out of my face?
what made you do it, kat? i was tired.
haven't gotten any sleep.
i felt like i was losing my edge.
i don't know what else to do.
couldn't you talk to someone? who am i gonna talk to? we're all in the same hole.
okay, there are no replacements coming up.
there's no down time.
this is it.
so i started taking stims.
d'anna you made a mistake, it happens, kat yeah, except now my flight's a pilot short, those guys, they're just as tired,,, and they're just as messed up as i was, but they're still laying it on the line, i've worked my ass off defending this fleet, i've been frustrated, i've been angry, i've been everything that you can possibly think of, but this is the first time that i've felt ashamed,  i've seen enough.
kill it.
look.
i understand this might be hard for you to watch-- it's a hatchet job. the fleet already thinks we're a bunch of trigger-happy assassins, this just confirms it.
you show us with our  down and our asses hanging out.
don't you have anything to say? i think it's great.
i think she did exactly what we asked her to do.
she put a human face on the ians of the fleet.
warts and all.
i'm proud of it.
you can show it to the entire fleet.
doesn't get better than that.
i'd like to see the end.
so would l.
go ahead.
yeah.
d'anna i came to galactica to tell a story, in all honesty, i thought i knew what that story was, before i ever set foot there, how an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their jobs, safeing the lives of the civilian population, but i found out that the truth was more complex than that, these people aren't cylons, they're not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots, they're people, deeply flawed, yes, but deeply human, too, and maybe that's saying the same thing, what struck me most is that, despite it all,,, the hardships, the stress, the ever-present danger of being killed, despite all that, they never give up, they never lie down on the road and let the truck run them over, they wake up in the morning, put on their uniforms and do their jobs, everyday, no pay, no rest, no hope of ever laying down the burden and letting someone else do the job, there are no relief troops coming, no colonial fleet training new recruits every day, the people on galactica are it, they are the thin line of blue that separates us from the cylons, lt, gaeta told me a remarkable statistic, not a single member of galactica's crew has asked to resign, not one, think about that, if you wore the uniform, wouldn't you want to quit? to step aside and say, enough, let someone else protect the fleet,  i know i would, but then, i don't wear a uniform, most of us don't, and most of us never will, the story of galactica isn't that people make bad decisions under pressure, it's that those mistakes are the exception, most of the time, the men and women,,, serving under cmdr, adama get it right, the proof is that our fleet survives, and with galactica at our side, we will endure, this is d' anna biers, fleet news service, that was shown across their entire fleet.
their resilience is remarkable.
play the footage that was cut.
sharon what are you doing?
stop it, cottle i'm trying to save your baby,  this is a restricted area!
sharon get off of me, i'm still alive.
she's still alive!
i told you.
that's incredible.
and the baby?
d'anna it was saved.
we lost two raiders relaying the images back to the fleet but, i think the sacrifice was worth it.
doral we must proceed with caution.
the child's life must be protected at all costs.
yeah. it truly is a miracle from god.
twelve cylon models seven are known four live in secre one will be revealed previously on battlestar galactica.
thus shall it come to pass. the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house.
where did you hear that?who told you that? the hybrid on the baseship before they unplugged it.
i've gotta find out about these visions.
plug it in.
it's time to get some answers.
can i see what you drew? hera! get away from my child!
you are never gonna take hera.
jump! heavenly father.
give me the strength,the wisdom,and above all.
quickly.
all right,on three.
three,two,one,move!
keep some pressure on that wound until i can get to the artery.
put some mask on.
kidnapped?
the president's been kidnapped?
i heard baltar was with her. are you saying he's responsible?
i heard it was the cylons.
no,my people say she was shot.
what are you talking aboutroslin?
no,one of adama's marines shot a cylon, and that is how this entire thing has begun.
sir,vice president zarek is still waiting to talk to you.
what should i tell him?
sir! deck crew says they just shipped over the last of the vipers.
means we're down 40 birds.
almost as many jocks.
we're gonna have to reconfigure the cap.
rethink our defense posture.
where is she? clamp.
marines are holding her.
my quarters.
everybody everybody just calm down,please!
mr.vice president,it's really important that we know. is the president dead?
wewe have no information i heard she was assassinated by the cylons.
no,there's no truth to that at least as far as we know.
then what the hell do we know?
clearly our first priority is to get out as much verifiable information as we can to avoid a general panic.
to that end,i asked admiral adama to come and answer our questions directly.
unfortunately,he wouldn't take my call.
however however please,please,just a moment.
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
after one of their own leaders was shot aboard galactica.
we have no idea when or if they will return, or if the president or the other captives will be subject to reprisals.
for now,under the powers granted me by law, i have taken over as president.
hear hear! by refusing even to meet with zarek, you're simply hel him fan the quorum's suspicions.
their suspicions don't concern me.
look,maybe he's not the man we hoped for,but he is next in line.
and the fleet needs reassurance and stability and frankly the kind that only its military commander can offer.
if this fleet needs reassurance,than you reassure them.
that's your job now.
you can tell zarek he can go to hell.
why? sir.do you hate your people so much, did you look for any excuse to kill one, or did you deliberately try to sabotage this truce?
no,sir,of course not.
then you tell me why.
you make me understand why you did this.
they were gonna take her. the six.
she was gonna take my child.
there were too many witnesses.
they all said the same thing.
your daughter was lost.
the cylon merely kneeled down and was talking to her. maybe that's what it looked like to the others,sir, but i know oh,you knew better.
i had a vision.
a vision where the six and baltar were taking hera away from me. a vision.
it was more than just a vision,sir.
when i saw them together,i knew that they would take her. that they would take away my child!
you murdered an unarmed woman, and by doing so you put the lives of every single person in this fleet at risk.
and quite possibly cost the lives of the president and your husband.
you disobeyed the direct orders of superior officer.
but more importantly.
you betrayed a promise to me.
i trusted you.
sir,i will accept any form of punishment that you think i deserve.
i just ask that you please don't take away hera.
i'm afraid the brig is no place for a little girl.
s!
get her out of my sight.
at one time,admiral adama supported gaius baltar's administration.
isn't there a chance he'd support yours? i'm afraid only admiral adama can answer that.
then i will address this question to delegate adama.
do you honestly think that your father will hand over power to this administration?
no. in search of a home called earth fine yeah.recon
raptor just reported back.
the resurrection hub's gone.
and there's no sign of the baseship which was carrying the president.
assuming that's where they were headed.
they were determined to resurrect the three.
the one we used to call d'anna.
to do that,they gotta go to the hub.
you find it and we'll find them.
easier said than done.
maybe.
we've got other problems.
starbuck's having trouble fielding enough planes to fly a standard cap.
wants us to consider having the fleet bunch up tighter so it's easier to defend.
means counting on a bunch of civvies flying close formation.
organize it.
i got you appointed to this job.
pulled strings.
called in favors.
all because i thought you might do some good.
now you're advising me to step aside from a position that by law is mine.
a position i was elected to.
but you were never elected president.
but i was elected to office! which is more than roslin can claim.
why do you think she kept me on in the first place?
to thank me for rolling over?
no.
no,to help legitimize her coup.
in the military.
we used to talk about facts on the ground.
well,the facts on the ground are these.
right or wrong,adama will never recognize you as president and we need someone he will.
now the quorum has the legal authority to appoint an interim president in a time of crisis.
and i suppose you have someone in mind.
no.
no,not yet.
which is why we need or fm a search committee and start looking for a candidate as soon as possible.
well.
good luck with that.
so vice president zarek,do you really believe that this government's in danger?
let's face facts,jim.
what we've had these past five years isn't a true government, but a tacit agreement between a military strongman and a political strongwoman to rule together by fiat.
i heard you asked the quorum to authorize the creation of a civil defense force.
after what happened during the last military coup, we don't want to depend on galactica's marines to guarantee our safety you see the problem.
lampkin's first rule of legal dynamics.
when an irresistible force.
meets immovable object.
stand aside.
and wait for the class action suit.
except i'm not sure if it's to anyone's benefit if we just sit around waiting to pick up the pieces.
this thing's heading for a showdown.
there's gonna be bloodshed,unless unless you can find someone else.
someone your father won't reject.
someone the quorum will approve of.
someone to take tom zarek's place as interim president until the next round of elections.
don't take the case,counselor.
it's a loser.
i have to.
we have to.
no one on the quorum is going to lift a finger.
zarek's got them inhaling fear and  anger.
but you have taken the pulse of the fleet,and you know character.
and frankly,you need a reason to get out of this room.
unless you want to start discussing what's been kee you here.
so you won't be dissuaded,will you? not even when you hear my fee? fee? appearances to the contrary,i'm actually in this for the money.
i have a reputation to maintain after all.
okay,so what did roslin offer you to defend baltar?
room with a view.
well,i'm not sure i can improve on that.
then pro bono it is,counselor.
a word to the wise.
sometimes it's better to settle for what you've already got.
colonel tigh.
i understand you've developed a relationship with the cylon prisoner.
that's not the word i'd use,but she had been more cooperative.
see if she'll tell you anything about the hub.
bill.
we'll find her.
we'll find all of them.
the resurrection hub.how do we find it?
i'm sure the others have told you.
you tell me.
only our hybrids can locate it.
and then only after it completes a jump.
even they can't anticipate where it's going.
you're holding back something.
i know it.
you're lying.
i have never lied to you,saul.
why don't you trust me now? because there are too many lives at stake,lady.
your buddies took off with half an air wing, not to mention the president of the frakkin' colonies herself.
she's the real reason you're so angry.
so worried.
i can hear it in your voice.
why? why is a dying woman so important to you? not to me,gods damn it.to
the old man! admiral adama?
saul.
do you love me? what?
be honest with me.
i've been honest with you.
i don't believe this.
you're asking me if attention!set
condition one throughout the ship.
this is not a drill.
this has gone too frakkin' far.
i don't know what kind of mind games you are playing with me, lady,but it ends here!
what do we got? one of our missing raptors jumped into dradis range.
you sure it's ours?
transponder checks out.
it's one of the raptors that boarded the missing baseship.
no radiological signature.
racetrack and skulls are on their way to intercept.
actual,racetrack.
i'm eyeballing our bird now.
looks shot to hell.
venting fuel and o2.
still no response to hails.
someone had to jump that bird.
i can't see a frakking thing from here.
skulls,take the wheel.i'm
going for a walk.
decompression check okay.
opening hatch.
safety line secure.
moving toward the raptor.
i'm seeing major damage to the canopy.
looks empty inside.
i've got the hatch open,but it's stuck.
grav field's off.
it's pike.
he's dead.
this is the shuttle she took over to the baseship.
laird was able to salvage the flight data recorder.
puts the originating jump point deep in sector delta nine.
president zarek called again. he heard about the raptor and he's waiting to be briefed.
recall the cap.
spin up the ftls.
what about the fleet?
let's go.
we are essentially looking for an understudy.
the quandary is one doesn't generally get the chance to wield political power without the ambition to actively seek it.
are you okay in there,lance?
that same ambition often compromises the unselfish motives that begat the quest.
in other words,a battle of id versus ego that ego rarely wins.
roslin never sought power.
exception that proves the rule.
one could argue that laura roslin is a study in repressed ambition.
just like you,mr.adama.
never seeking out a job until it's handed to you.
flight leader,battlestar commander,quorum delegate.
a man doesn't carve out a path like that through life without all right,enough of the psychoanalysis.
let's get back to the job in hand.
does your father have some other place he wants to go? what?
where the hell did they go? and why didn't they tell us? galactica,racetrack. we've located the source of the transponder.
it's sandman's viper all right.
but no sandman.
affirmative.
keep searching.
we're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.
baseship fragments,other debris indicative of resurrection technology.
i'm afraid it paints a pretty clear picture.
they found the hub and they destroyed it.
looks like our pilots helped.
question is,where'd they go from here?
bill,you are way too close to this. the president's baseship was destroyed.
it's a different baseship.
and we'll search every square inch of this debris field until we come up with a clue.
what,and leave the rest of the fleet back there with their asses hanging in the wind?
detail four raptors to stay behind.
they keep searching until they find something concrete.
give my order.
good people,listen up.
what are we gonna do here?
they've left 35,000 lives.
all right,everybody,gather around,please.
gather around.
please,please! i'm sorry,admiral adama will not be coming to answer your questions.
i did learn,however,that he contacted the fleet's captains to inform them that several of their ships will be requisitioned to expand the search for laura roslin and the missing baseship.
while all tylium shipments will be diverted to support that mission.
but he's bypassing us completely!
i understand.
i understand.we're
doing the best i understand that is nothing short of a military coup!
captain franks?
i was impressed by her gravitas during her turn as judge in the baltar trial.
that and her vote,naturally.
no,she's already been approached to run for office.
no interest in politics.
sadly,now she really impresses me.
gods.
you ever feed that animal?
where is he,anyway?
come on,romo,let's put our heads together.
we can do better than this.who would adama respect as president?
good question.
what does this search for paragons net us anyway except greater guilt at our own failings?
or worse,the idiot's illusion of the clean slate.
a fresh start.
we haven't ruled out all these names yet.
this one's a loser.
an exercise in futility.
lawyers.
how's this gonna affect the president the break in her treatment?
assuming no other changes in her circumstances?
yes.
well,doloxan really kicks your ass, so she actually might feel better at first.
but any break gives the cancer a chance to regroup.
makes it that much harder to beat it back.
plus she's taken a hit to her immune system so she'll be vulnerable to infections.
how long?
well,let's just say that the sooner you get her back here, the better her chances are.
and while you're digesting that,i have some other news.
i ran some tests on your cylon prisoner.
guess what i found.
raptors are due back in a few hours.
granted,if they'd have found anything we would have heard from them by now.
still,once we correlate their reports i'm not interested in the search.
you're not? i know that you've been spending a lot of time interrogating the six.
but now the brig s tell me that every time you order them out that you turn off the cameras.
i'm not torturing her,if that's what you're worried about.
i'm not.
that i could almost understand.
this i can't.
cottle tells me she's pregnant.
what the frak have you been thinking,colonel?
do you deny it?
you don't.
you can't! what the hell have you been thinking?
who was interrogating who? how many of our secrets have you told this thing?
how can you even ask me that?
question my loyalty?
your loyalty?
i need more than your loyalty.
you're my first officer.
i need judgment.
i need your competence.
i'm through jeopardizing this ship, putting it at risk because of your weakness.
my weakness?
yeah,your weakness!
you're risking all our lives for what?
our missing pilots?no,for a woman!
for a frakkin' woman!
you watch what you frakkin' say about that woman.
she's the president.
not some frakkin' skinjob that i've been banging.
what do you think ellen would say about this? you leave ellen out of this.
what do you think ellen would say about her husband impregnating a frakkin' cylon prisoner.
you mother-frakker!
you know how many times i've had to repair this thing?
what are you gonna do with that woman?
what are you gonna do about laura if you ever find her? i don't know.
have the raptors and the civilian ships begin their search from phantom's last known position.
is that a problem?
sir,respectfully,i've already got two missing pilots and hardly enough birds left to protect this fleet.
now you're asking me to send the remainder of the raptors out on a blind search looking for a ship that very well may be destroyed.
my people are gonna feel like their being asked to go on suicide missions.
i'm not asking.
you're dismissed,captain.
admiral adama.
mr.lampkin,what are you doing here?
writs of forfeiture for the ships you're borrowing.
the captains want to be absolved of any blame should anything untoward happen.
one of the less ennobling consequences of a legal culture.
no one wants responsibility.
lee said you once gave him something before a mission.
a lighter,was it?
belonged to my father.
foolish to think a hunk of metal could keep him safe.
and yet,that's what we do,isn't it?
hang onto hope in every hopelessly irrational way that we can.
but not like those poor bastards giving away their luck just when they need it most.
it's like they've given up.
if you've never been in combat,you have no idea what they're thinking.
i always imagined you a realist,admiral.
not one to indulge a vain hope at the cost of lives.
but then.
everyone has his limits.
sine qua non, as they say.
without which not.  yes.
those things we deem essential without which we cannot bear living.
without which life in general loses its specific value.
becomes abstract.
you may have a point,counselor.
then while i'm on a roll.
tom zarek may not be an ideal president,but we could do worse.
you're right.
there are limits to my realism.
good-bye,counselor.
i can't give up on her.
i can't let her go.
i've lost my objectivity.
and now that i see that,i have no choice.
tell the quorum that i'm relinquishing command effective immediately.
no man is perfect.
no man is less perfect than a candidate for high office.
and thus.
the ranks of likely suspects is winnowed to none.
what if we're going about this backwards?
hey,lance?
what if instead of.
picking names and finding fault that we ask ourselves the qualities that we that we want no.
no,what we need in a new chief executive and see who fits that bill.
honesty,of course.
the wisdom to recognize the correct from popular choice.
as well the courage to see it through.
experience.
when the wrong choices cost lives and the right sesave.
tall order.
we might as well spell out one name.
just one.
one we knew from the start.
sometimes you take on a losing case and you make yourself a believer.
other times,no matter what you tell yourself.
in your heart.
you know the outcome is fixed.
the verdict inevitable.
lance,defense rests.
come on.
apologies.
i couldn't wait to tell you.
tell me what?
we found our candidate.
someone the quorum won't hesitate to approve even over zarek's objections.
someone the admiral can't help but accept.
yeah?who?
congratulations,mr.president.
my name was never on that list. of course not.
that would be too blatant.
but it is everything you always wanted,isn't it?
why you had me cross 47 names off that list.
come on.
admit it.
savor your victory,mr.adama.
'cause you'll never get the chance to serve.
what are you doing?
why? 'cause you're perfect for the job,of course.
'cause after the vicious aberration that was baltar's presidency, and the bitter disappointment that was roslin's,you are.
a shining beacon of hope.
only hope is the last thing we need.
we're a doomed race.
and it's time that we made our peace with that essential truth.
romo,what the hell are you talking about?
why?you want to know why? open it!
that's right.
they killed my cat! they?
they! those debased dregs of humanity out there.
our lost tribe in search of a new home so they can roost and rot again.
romo,how long has the cat been dead?
how long?
it's irrelevant!it's immaterial!
since it wasn't even my cat.
romo,he's been dead for weeks.
it belonged to my wife.
i just retrieved him from a vet on gemenon when the bombs started to fall, and fate presented me with a choice.
i could get back on that shuttle or.
i could run home and.try to save my family.
how do you think i chose?
romo,we've all had to make difficult choices.
you don't think i know?
your wife's name was faye.
you had two daughters,jennifer and katie.
there were over 200 passengers on that shuttle.
only a handful chose to stay behind.
yeah,that's right.
it was in your file when you were handed the job as baltar's counsel.
but no one blamed you,romo.
because at a certain point, we all made decisions that saved our lives at the cost of others.
you think you're unique,romo?
think your sins are so special? is that it,counselor?
you're gonna rest your entire case on that pathetic little bit of insight?
no. on this. the clean slate,the fresh start, maybe they are illusions like you said.
but at a certain point, faith in ourselves in our right to survive as a species, as a people,that's not a given.
that's a choice.
well,i've made mine.
and if you can't stomach that, then you had damn well better squeeze that trigger right now.
go on.
what are you waiting for?
or you can make a choice.
put your past behind you.
put the gun down.
and help me.
because i'm telling you,i'm gonna make a difference in this fleet.
is that your final word? that's up to you.
then swear it.
i,leland joseph adama,do now avow and affirm.
that i take the office of president of the 12 colonies of kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
that i take the office of president of the 12 colonies of kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
this is a frakkin' joke.
you're the only man i can trust to command this ship.
maybe you're crazy enough to pull a stunt like this, but you can't be crazy enough to leave me in charge.
in case you forgot,my last term at the helm was a complete disaster.
that was a long time ago.
you're not the same man that you were.
you're not even the same man who came back from new caprica.
you found out a lot about yourself.
been tested in ways i can barely begin to imagine.
you're ready.
besides.
don't count on this being permanent.
what if it is?
put these on.
and you lead the people to earth the best way you can. the fleet has stayed here too long already.
any other last orders?
just one.
give athena back her daughter.
she needs her family.
we all need our family.
take care of this one.
all right,let me see the changes before you get this out to the press.
all right.
thank you. mr.lampkin.
romo.
one day in office and you're already got a first pet.
jake here is a genuine hero of the resistance.
aren't you,jake?
unfortunately,his previous owners had to let him go.
jake,meet romo.
romo,meet jake.
your new best friend.
if there's one thing i hate more than cats,it's dogs.
see,a new pet for you to loathe.
i knew it would be the perfect gift.
good luck,jake.
i hear you're kee zarek as vice president.
i can use the advice.
and as long as he knows he's heard,i think i can trust him.
i don't know if i agree with your thinking.
well,i could say the same thing about yours.
the only difference is you're gonna be president.
i'm just getting in a plane.
waiting alone in a raptor while the rest of the fleet jumps away.
that's not just getting in a plane.
that sounds a lot like well,it sounds a lot like suicide,dad.
at least this time i'm only risking my own neck.
so i guess it won't matter if as president i order you not to do this?
i don't know if i ever told you this,but one of my first missions was a solo recon.
me alone in a raptor in enemy space.
i'm not gonna lie to you.i was scared.
told myself that i was doing my duty,and ultimately i faced my fear.
that's a good memory.
why are you doing this? because i can't live without her.
and laura's gonna get to the rendezvous point.
i have to believe that.
admiral.
admiral.
what do you hear,starbuck? nothing but the rain,sir.
grab your gun and bring the cat in.
yes,sir.
keep a light on.
i'll be back.
you can count on it.
galactica,this is husker.
i'm in position.
affirmative,husker.
all fleet ships,this is galactica actual.
commence jump.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica  i notice you're calling her sharon now.
no.
6: she acts like them, thinks like them.
no.
6: she's one of them.
doral: but she's one of us.
boomer: we gotta go, now.
we gotta travel fast.
even faster than before.
roslin: they found him in the storage compartment.
he's another copy of the cylon you know as leoben.
i'll send a team over to destroy it.
anything it says cannot be trusted.
don't!
adama is a cylon.
commander?
here's dr.
baltar's report.
and the president is waiting for you up in the core.
thank you. adama: clear the deck.
adama: madame president, we are the proud owners of the universe's first, bona-fide cylon detector.
that is great news.
yeah.
so, when do we begin?
dr.
baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible but there are some serious limitations.
he can only do one person at a time, and verification takes hours.
so who's going to go first?
the tests.
right.
i think people in sensitive positions should go first.
i completely agree.
how about you? excuse me? if you're a cylon, i'd like to know.
if i'm a cylon, you're really screwed.
seriously, i do think that you should go first.
show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top.
then maybe you should go first.
all right, i'll go first.
i think that's good.
i do.
pilot: bank on my advice.
they always do that?
no, they're just showing off.
they know i'm in here.
you date a special assistant to the president, word gets out.
so this is officially a date?
jury's still out.
man:  observation deck has two minutes remaining.
dualla: you could pull rank.
you could tell them you're on special business for the president of the colonies.
your boss pulls more weight around here than mine.
you can tell them adama wants you to yeah, what? wants me to what? i lost my train of thought.
how is he these days, by the way? the old man?
he's fine, i guess.
you guess?
he's been acting kind of funny lately.
seems distracted or something.
he's been making all these weird calls from his quarters.
super secret.
probably a security thing.
they don't want me to log the calls, though.
no trace file.
nothing.
and this just started? a few days ago.
billy keikeya, are you pum me for information about the old man?
deckhand: time's up.
no. of course not.
you are.
you are.
you're a spy, that's what you are.
i was just asking a couple of questions.
i hope you liked the answers.
because they're the last ones you're gonna get for a while.
roslin: what did you find out?
dualla couldn't put her finger on it but, yeah, she said he's been acting differently.
i could see that myself.
he was distracted and unfocused.
what else? some scrambled wireless calls he didn't want logged.
she didn't know who he called or why.
but none of this is damning evidence.
billy: the calls could be security-related and his odd behaviour could be stress, pure and simple.
exhaustion, paranoia all right.
it could be any of those things.
roslin: but what if it's not?
madame president, with all due respect i cannot believe we're actually entertaining the idea that commander adama has been somehow replaced by a cylon duplicate.
oh, my gods, billy i hope you're right.
is suicide really a sin? no.
6: a mortal one, i'm afraid.
but it's not that bad, is it, gaius?
baltar: eleven hours to test each one for cylon indicators.
no.
6: that'll take awhile.
no.
6: 60.1534 years.
now, let's figure in a few hours to sleep here and there.
baltar: we'll call it an even 61, shall we? no.
6: sure.
i prefer to kill myself.
commander adama, are you a cylon?
baltar: tune in tomorrow.
no.
6: it's hard being a genius.
baltar: yes.
no.
6: there should be some perks.
baltar: yes.
no.
no.
starbuck: what's up, doc?  lt.
thrace, good to see you.
i was just kee up with the old exercises.
that should do me for today.
baltar: i feel all better.
baltar: what brings you to the lab at this time of the night?
starbuck: it's mid-afternoon.
baltar: yeah, it is.
crazy workload.
i totally lose track of time.
so, what can i do for you?
you can zip up your fly.
so my blood test.
no.
6: you're right about one thing, gaius.
there is something very intriguing about her. very good.
very good.
at least i did that much.
dradis, contact!
cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005.
galactica, apollo.
action stations.
cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005.
relative zero.
close with enemy, destroy.
acknowledge.
apollo: we're on it, galactica.
he jumped right in front of us.
his mistake.
how many?
single raider.
looks like a recon patrol.
apollo and beehive have them in their sight.
tigh: where's the old man?
dualla: he's not aboard.
not aboard?
where the hell is he? he left in a raptor about an hour ago.
dualla: no flight plan.
tigh: no flight plan?
apollo: that's it.
you set him up, i'll knock him down.
apollo: i winged him.
looks like i got his weapon systems. he jumped.
he jumped away before we could zero him out.
damn it.
probably giving away our position to every cylon base ship right now.
where in the hell is the old man?
order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures.
everyone rendezvous at the stand-by coordinates.
contact!
single raider bearing 881 carom 247.
apollo, galactica, cylon raider detected at 881 carom 24 apollo: wait, i see him!
same raider.
tigh: what?
it's the same raider.
i can see the damage from before.
it's behaving erratically.
he jumped away again.
contact.
single raider, same telltales.
it's like he's just flying around in circles.
wounded bird.
can't fly home.
apollo: galactica.
we got him on dradis, but he's pretty far out there.
take us three minutes to close to weapons range.
no.
this is our perfect chance to get some intel.
order apollo to close with the raider, but do not engage.
put a raptor in the air.
as long as that's flop around out there tell them i want to suck in every electronic signal it makes.
sir.
colonel, commander adama's raptor is requesting permission dualla: to enter the landing pattern.
tigh: permission granted.
tigh: stand down to condition two.
dualla: permission granted.
tigh: mr.
gaeta, you have the deck.
adama: permission to come aboard?
tigh: granted.
tigh: mind telling me where the hell you've been?
col.
tigh, allow me to present your wife.
ellen?
helo: that noise.
i don't get it.
i've blown centurions away before.
they've never sent an entire army after me.
boomer: they're after me.
helo: why you? while they were holding me, i overheard some things.
helo: what?
boomer: plans.
deployments.
there's a big cylon base at delphi.
a major hub.
helo: delphi?
frakking bastards.
the best place to try and grab a ship and get off this frakking planet.
dr.
gaius baltar, department of cylon detection how may i direct your call?
roslin: you're in a good mood.
baltar: madame president  i'm sorry.
i was expecting someone else.
we haven't spoken in ages.
doctor, i'd like you to call me the moment commander adama's test is complete.
will you do that?
commander adama cancelled his test a short time ago.
why? i don't know. he gave me another sample.
he said it had priority.
whose?
i'll just check.
some woman called ellen.
no surname.
he dropped it off and left. is there a problem?
dr.
baltar, i would like you to resume testing commander adama's blood sample immediately.
thank you. i can't believe you're alive.
i can't believe it myself.
saul, i don't remember the last few weeks.
ellen: it's weeks, right?
tigh: right.
you've been on the rising star all this time?
ellen: i guess so. the last thing i remember is being on picon.
i was at the airport buying a ticket home and hearing something about the cylons.
and then just dreams, mostly dreams until a couple days ago.
ellen: they tell me i was knocked out when the cylons attacked the airport.
and someone just picked me up and put me on the last flight out.
some saviour.
i don't even know who.
it's all right.
you're here now.
starbuck: it's like we found a treasure chest.
one of the major issues we've been having with the raider we captured is to figure the faster-than-light drive.
this wounded bird is jum all over the place out there.
yeah.
and every time it jumps, it gives us more data that we can use.
but what was it doing out there, and how long can it keep it up? the moment you have your ftl data, give me an update.
let's not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to.
tyrol: yes, sir.
you wanted to see me, sir? stay on it.
you have dinner plans?
what?
come on.
ellen: i never thought i'd see you again.
tigh: me neither.
the things i said before, the things i did in the past?
it's all in the past.
start over?
start over.
i i can't.
forget it i can't.
i'm on duty.
xo.
now? understood.
all right.
tell her i'm on my way.
girlfriend?
official business.
feels like old times.
i'd explain, but it's classified.
i'll be back as soon as i can.
i'll be here, waiting.
as soon as i can.
you want to be very, very careful with what you just said.
you're talking about a man i owe my life to, many times over.
i know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you.
excuse me, colonel.
i do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me.
but i would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret.
i need to know if you have seen anything suspicious about his recent behaviour?
no.
what about the fact that he left the galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return and at that very moment, a cylon raider jumped into view and started acting strangely?
i know exactly where he was.
roslin: you do? tigh: he was picking up my wife.
your wife?
turns out she's been unconscious aboard the rising star ever since the attack.
roslin: oh, my gods!
roslin: that's fantastic.
that's amazing.
tigh: yes, it is.
when ellen stepped off that shuttle, i thought i was going to pass out.
ellen?
your wife's name is ellen?
yes, it is.
ellen.
ellen tigh.
i'd very much like to meet your wife, colonel.
resume the test on ellen?
no, it's no trouble at all.
tigh: ellen?
did you shut the door?
i already did.
surprise.
ambrosia?
where did you get this?
i have my ways.
ellen: i thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration.
we need to talk.
first things first.
there.
starting over.
starting over.
i'm technically still on duty.
i think they can do without you for a day.
tigh: it doesn't really work that way.
starting over.
sure, there's whining and complaining like you would expect but the people i talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic.
that's good to hear.
there are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be president but they're just a tiny minority.
wonderful.
everyone is so truly grateful to all of you on galactica.
you literally are our saviours.
we're just doing our jobs.
you are so modest.
he's always been that way.
lee, could i trouble you for a little more of this lovely ambrosia?
sure.
thank you, dear.
bill, you must be so proud of your sons.
lee here has grown into such a handsome man.
i can only imagine what zak must look like now.
you are the spitting image of your mother and i bet zak takes just after his daddy.
adama: zak passed away a couple of years ago.
i'm sorry.
how tragic, the death of a child.
there's been so much death, so much pain.
sometimes it's completely overwhelming.
i'm sure he was a beautiful boy.
the captain of the rising star was puzzled as to how you got on his ship.
i know.
i know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from almost certain death, and put me on the last flight out of picon.
how lucky for us all.
yes, indeed.
the strange thing is no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago.
i know.
it's a miracle i'm alive.
apollo: i think i better clear some of these dishes.
you are so sweet.
very good.
my compliments to the chef.
so, bill, now the question on everyone's mind and i do mean everyone apollo: sorry.
ellen: it's okay.
is where is earth and when do we get there?
that's classified information.
that word again.
leave the man alone.
ellen: come on, if there are no privileges of being an xo's wife then what's the point?
bill, we're all family here.
come on.
the need for secrecy is paramount, ellen.
i'm sorry.
perhaps you don't know that the cylons look like us now.
that, yes, i knew that.
it's recent news.
most people found out a few days ago.
a thing like that would travel fast.
right?
any one of us could be a cylon.
boo!  did you see the looks on their faces?
you are too easy.
thank you so much for coming.
it's been a wonderful evening.
tigh: thought it would never end.
i seemed to have lost one of my shoes.
i think it's right here.
thank you. apollo: here we are.
you look very, very happy.
that's because i am very happy.
thank you.  it was nice to see you again.
the pleasure's all mine.
hope to see you soon.
i'm sure you will.
hang on.
watch your step.
good night.
lovely dinner.
tigh: i've got her.
adama: be careful.
you actually think that woman is a cylon?
if she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble.
ellen: when did bill become such a stick-in-the-mud? the man's a carving.
he's one of those faces on a totem pole.
she slept with more than half the fleet, while saul was in space.
why the hell did he stay married to her? it's obvious.
he loves her deeply.
blindly.
ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy bring out this self-destructive streak in him.
used to?
helo: sharon, stop!
i can't keep up.
boomer: helo, come on.
you can do it.
please.
you have to get up.
boomer: there.
right there.
boomer: turn your light off.
we gotta find another way out of here.
we're going.
why aren't you waiting?
you keep going and going.
you never get tired.
it's adrenaline.
i'm not gonna die here.
and i'm not gonna let you die here either.
boomer: okay, let's go! tigh: don't worry, i'll get us home.
ellen: yeah, right.
just like bill's getting us to earth.
don't start on bill.
he doesn't have the slightest idea where earth is.
you don't have to yell it through the halls.
bill adama doesn't know where earth is! colonel.
doctor.
baltar: actually, i don't believe i've had the pleasure.
i'm dr.
gaius baltar.
i know exactly who you are.
and the pleasure's all mine.
something here, isn't there?
ellen: you're still holding my hand.
baltar: that's funny.
i thought you were still holding onto mine.
i'm watching you.
both of you.
no.
6: and you should be watching her.
care to join us for a nightcap, doctor?
i'd love to.
gaeta:  dr.
baltar, report to the lab. the commander is waiting.
but i can't.
another time, perhaps.
count on it.
ta-ta!
oh, saulie, are you jealous?
you said we were starting over.
we are, sweetheart, we are.
that was just a little harmless flirting.
ellen: you should know something.
tigh: what? in the middle of dinner bill put his hand on my leg.
ellen, i'm not falling for this.
did you know he came to see me on the rising star?
what?
he'd come into my room.
i'd pretend to be asleep.
then he'd sit by the side of my bed and then he'd touch me.
why are you doing this? you're lying.
i am not. he was on that ship.
i'll prove it.
come on!
look, it's not magic.
it's science.
if you want the right result, you have to wait awhile.
i gave you her sample this morning.
i have started and stopped the test twice already now so i'm running a little behind.
twice?
my fault.
long story.
your fault?
i shouldn't have mentioned that.
you shouldn't have.
did you tell him to stop ellen's test?
yes, i did.
why? i had some concerns.
about what? in all honesty, i think it's fair to say that your behaviour recently has been odd.
my behaviour?
what do you think, i'm a cylon?
me? you can't deny that you've been making these off-log calls, these mysterious trips off the ship.
where did you hear that?
have you been spying on me? on my own ship?
ladies and gentlemen, please.
we're in a laboratory.
there are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere.
that's a thermo-nuclear bomb, for frak's sakes.
what do you mean un-logged?
mysterious trips?
what's going on?
i had to go to the rising star and i didn't want tigh to know.
why not? because whether or not his wife is a cylon, she's trouble and i wanted to keep her away as long as i could.
then why did you bring her aboard the ship?
because she's his wife.
and i couldn't refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion.
besides, i wanted her close to me.
i told you.
i told you he wanted me.
lovely.
what the hell's going on?
you have been secretly visiting my wife?
no.
yes.
but it's complicated.
i told you.
he's been after me for years.
what? now boys, boys, don't fight over little old me.
ellen, be quiet!
you don't tell me what to do.
apollo: we should all take a deep breath.
roslin: i will!
i was afraid that she might be a cylon!
i brought her blood here to test it.
tigh: that's why you cancelled your test.
adama: how'd you know that?
tigh: you didn't tell me he was testing my wife.
you met with the president?
yes.
she thought you might be a cylon.
i know.
gaeta: attention.
pass the word for the commander, xo and the cag.
commander adama, col.
tigh, and captain adama, please report to cic.
adama: mr.
gaeta.
the raider smoothed out its flight path about two minutes ago. it seems to be under control.
yeah, but he's not jum for home.
no, sir, he isn't.
has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since he straightened out his flight pattern?
yes, sir, but it's likely it's just another distress signal.
launch the alert fighters.
this is the cag.
launch the alert fighters.
sir, i hate to tell you this, but i think it's been playing with us the entire time.
it was waiting to see how we'd react.
playing with us? yeah.
order the flight leader to destroy the target!
yes, sir.
galactica, hot dog. the raider just took off! he doesn't look injured to me.
he's heading back to the fleet!
they're not going to catch him.
action stations, set condition one.
this is not a drill.
he doesn't have any weapons.
he's on a suicide run.
did you launch the alert fighters?
it was the xo's call.
i had a hunch.
good call.
one question.
because i was worried.
that she might be a cylon.
and if she wasn't.
i know how you feel about her, saul.
she's been a negative force in your life.
i'm sorry, but it's the truth.
maybe she was.
everything was different then.
she was different.
i was different.
i've grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand.
so i had a couple of drinks tonight.
i was celebrating.
i think i deserved to yes, you did.
launching those fighters on a hunch.
you saved our ship.
tigh: just doing my job.
adama: you do your job good.
that's why i need you, saul.
that, and that we're friends.
i don't want anything to come between that, not even ellen.
it won't.
doral: we've searched every street, every building.
they slipped through.
how's that possible?
she thinks she loves him.
now that she can't live without him.
her passion is making her more resourceful.
bothers you, doesn't it?
we'll get them in the end.
no, it bothers you that you've never experienced it.
you saw the way helo was when we took her away? he was pathetic.
i can't help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely.
even in his anguish, he seemed so alive.
green.
green, everyone.
mrs.
tigh is definitely human.
no hard feelings, i hope, ellen.
i completely understand.
but let's be sure and test you next.
doctor?
my pleasure.
my job.
you don't want to frak with me, bill.
try to remember that.
don't frak with me either, ellen.
if only they knew that everyone passes these days.
why, it's so much simpler that way.
no muss, no fuss.
what did her test really say? i'll never tell.
.
previously on battlestar galactica.
we networked the ftl computer with a nav dc and fire control computers.
once they're linked, we'll only need 10 minutes to complete the calculations.
really?
you're going to outthink the cylons at computer software?
cylons are hacking our network.
attempting to access our mainframe.
what the hell was that?
it's the virus, sir.
i think it must have spawned copies of itself in some other computer systems.
it's knocked out main power and auxiliary units.
i love you, chief.
what do you want from me, helo?
she's a cylon.
i'm not going to let you kill her.
she's carrying my child.
i have terminal breast cancer.
dr.
cottle will verify the diagnosis.
i have a few months to live.
five-four-two-eight-niner. so, how are we feeling today?
great!
helo thought i'd find you here.
karl agathon.
you wanna sit in? maybe next time.
so, he's the cylon lover?
you know what?
i don't care who or what he fraks.
he saved my ass down there, all right?
how could anyone fall in love with a toaster, though?
same way i hear everyone was high-fiving our sharon right before she put two in adama's chest.
the bastards frak with your head.
yeah.
just ask the chief.
i knew it.
i need a drink.
tanned, rested and ready!
look at you.
rested, anyway.
nothing to do but eat and sleep in the can.
unauthorized discharge of a firearm.
what a bogus charge.
they should have given you a medal for pop that toaster.
chief, i heard that you went to bat for me.
forget it.
i just want you to know-- forget it.
i need all the knuckle draggers i can get.
tyrol sharon flew 47 missions in this thing and still couldn't trap a landing worth a damn.
had to bend her undercarriage back into place after every landing.
approaches made her nervous.
she was afraid you'd be watching.
i usually was.
screw it.
you're folding with three up?
are you crazy?
not when you've got me beat.
prince high red, right?
been playing with these cards for so long, i know every fold.
so, life's a bitch.
what do you want to do, cry about it?
no, i just want it to end, okay? the bad food, the endless rotations pretending that a card game is the high point of our day!
it's not going to last forever, all right.
earth is out there.
right.
we could all be chasing our tails over some half-assed planetarium show.
you guys can all go to hell.
i'm gonna go find helo.
good idea.
maybe that cylon whore taught him a few tricks.
look, chief.
i never intended for sharon to know that.
you know, it just kind of evolved.
just a couple of lovesick kids, huh? i know how she felt about you.
she loved you.
did she fill you in on the rest of the plan?
she and i were going to muster out at the end of our service.
you know? that we would get married maybe we would have children.
i guess i'm just a big frakking idiot, though, huh? probably that godsdamn toaster's plan all along.
don't call her that.
to sucker some moron into giving her a kid.
but you know what?
i should probably be grateful to you.
probably be grateful.
you know why? because that freak in her belly could've been mine.
hey.
you okay? sorry.
son of a bitch!
that's enough, chief.
you don't get to call it.
enough!   come on, you damn toaster lover!
i don't even know why i'm mad at you.
my sharon's dead.
that thing in the brig that isn't sharon.
roger, blue leader.
say fuel state.
what the hell is that? it was us, sir.
but i can't find the source of the transmission.
something's triggering our comm system to broadcast an automatic signal.
which the cylons could trace to get a fix on our position.
let's assume that for now.
update and distribute emergency jump sites just in case they show up again.
dee, get me a.    i'm okay, sir.
no.
no, stay down.
we'll get you to doc cottle to make sure everything's okay.
mr.
gaeta, find out what happened.
i'm okay.
mr.
gaeta? a power surge energized the board.
system's been twitchy ever since the cylons infiltrated our network.
mr.
gaeta, this is more than a twitch.
the commander's right.
i don't care if you have to go through this program line by line.
fix it.
excuse me? you heard me.
sir, i'm running every diagnostic we've got.
checking each line of code could take days.
i am not interested in excuses.
fix it.
it's not an excuse, sir.
it's a frakking fact!
mr.
gaeta.
yes, sir.
pull yourself together.
i'm sorry, sir.
what the hell is his problem?
months on the run and what do we have to show for it?
casualties.
deteriorating conditions.
this crew needs a rest.
it's finally hitting them, saul.
our old lives are gone.
the only thing we have to look forward to is this.
chief, where's 2-8-niner?
i need her for drills today.
she was grounded, sir.
what? for how long?
permanently.
we're salvaging what we can, but it's gone.
damn it, i need that ship on line.
what can i tell you, captain?
engine mounts are shot, cockpit seals are cracked.
if it was a horse, they'd shoot it.
got something, chief.
apollo chief, come on.
work with me here.
i need your help.
what do you want me to do? work my crew to death?
no.
just do your best.
nobody's expecting any miracles.
maybe that's the problem.
tyrol frak it, why not? what's going on, chief?
all right, here's the deal.
we are going to build a new fighter.
what about the rest of the ships?
i'm three days backlogged on repairs as is.
this is strictly an off-duty project.
nobody takes one minute away from regular maintenance and repairs.
you got it?
you don't think we can do this?
i wouldn't even know how to begin.
what else is new?
screw you.
okay.
he's talking about fabricating a frame, avionics, life support.
it's frakking impossible.
you know what, then?
forget you.
i don't need you.
chief, wait.
it's not like that.
i said forget it.
get back to work.
that's an order.
how much time do i have?
weeks.
a month at the outside.
will i be able to work? unless the cancer goes to your brain.
if that happens.
someone's a tad aggressive.
just shut up and shoot.
my gods, between you and racetrack, it's like.
having a conversation is like walking through a minefield.
and you're the last person who should be lecturing me about manners.
from what i hear, you've also been riding chief tyrol pretty good.
press it.
i just reminded him that i expect viper maintenance to take precedence over his hobby project.
starbuck nice.
i'm surprised he didn't take a swing at you.
come on, starbuck.
you don't actually think that piece of junk's gonna actually fly, do you?
fifty cubits says he gets it in the air.
yeah? and who's gonna fly it?
it's not gonna be me.
don't look at me! apollo i wasn't looking at you.
what?
i'll fly it.
i'll fly it.
you? me.
why? because while everyone else is standing around whining apollo we're whining? the chief is doing something positive.
i'm deeply moved.
really?
honestly, i am.
his lips are blue!
you look like a blueberry.
there's no oxygen in here.
there's no oxygen in here.
no oxygen.
i'm out.
nice shot.
the environmental computer decided that the  range was over pressurized and started bleeding out air to compensate.
two more minutes, we may have been dead.
power fluctuations.
equipment failures.
sir, i think i've found what's causing it.
what is that?
baltar a cylon logic bomb.
a heuristic computer virus.
it's capable of learning, evolving.
it's probably running in parallel with every computer in the ship, right now just waiting to be activated.
no doubt left behind when the cylons infiltrated the network col.
tigh set up the day you were shot, sir.
that was weeks ago.
why now? most likely, sir, it took that long for it to crack our encrypted pass-codes.
and once that happened, it started testing its ability to control our systems.
electrical, environmental.
how do you kill it?
well, that's the tricky part.
if it's a cylon virus, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.
well, i guess i'm pretty lucky then.
because i have an expert onboard.
tell helo to run this past our prisoner.
come on.
come on.
for frak's sakes.
son of a bitch!
gods damn it!
i got it.
go back to work.
it's a two-man job, chief.
you want this wing up or not? on three.
one, two, three.
tyrol great.
great, hold it there.
pull it that way.
sir, we're continuing to experience power spikes and equipment failures across the ship.
thank you. we'd better up our alert status and put our damage control teams on standby.
not yet.
have you seen the ship that the chief is building?
his imaginary fighter?
i don't need to see it.
i know it's a waste of time.
the deck crew doesn't seem to think so.
we need to focus on the fleet we've got left not get bogged down in some pipe dream.
you should shut it down.
it may come to that.
this project, it's giving them something.
i'm not going to take that away until i have to.
doc cottle cleared me.
and i feel like hitting something.
okay.
don't square up.
don't square up.
rotate, and just drop the knee.
that's nice.
now, if you want to throw them i'll be you.
head in a lock, grab the wrist, secure the arm and i'm just gonna drop the knee, rotate 45. okay.
are you all right?
yeah.
just like we did in basic.
let's bring a live opponent into the mix.
man nice.
and strip the knife.
dualla billy.
hey.
hey.
how long have you been onboard?
i just arrived.
do you have actual memories of being with the chief before the cylon attack?
yeah, i'm sorry.
you asked.
do you still love him?
helo you're the father of my child, you're the first in my heart and nothing is ever going to change that, all right.
we have to get to this.
dr, baltar says it's some sort of cylon logic bomb, do you see anything?
can you flip? sharon?
sharon?
sharon, i need to talk to cmdr.
adama.
right now.
why? it's a cylon virus, all right.
it's been learning your systems.
testing, adapting, finding weak spots.
for what?
so they can turn galactica's systems against you.
crash you into other ships, detonate your weapons stores,,, suffocate the crew, what about you? the baby?
i'm a liability to them a mistake, helo, this logic bomb will run its course in a matter of hours.
once it does, the cylons will be on top of us.
they're going to kill us all, cmdr.
adama-- whatever it is you have to say, make it quick.
well, i hate to say it, but you've got the cockpit too far back.
you're gonna run into cg problems when you maneuver.
we're not going for maneuverability, captain.
we're going for speed.
besides, you didn't think this thing would fly anyway.
well, it sure as hell won't with the cockpit rammed up its-- dee? hey.
apollo what are you doing here?
communications, i think.
she's great with hydraulics, but this comm system is a mess.
ten-hut.
i had to see this with my own eyes.
won't be long before we have the whole clc down here.
you working on this class project, too, apollo?
no.
it's good to see someone has a little sense.
where's the chief?
tool room?
aye, getting some rack time, sir.
tigh what's this, chief?
making solvent, sir. to clean engine parts.
solvent, my ass.
i know a still when i smell it, what the hell are you up to?  i need booze to trade for parts.
i'm scrounging most of what i can from the fleet.
but i need engines.
i know i need cmdr.
adama's permission to cannibalize one of the wrecks.
engines or not, we both know that piece of crap out there is never going to fly.
i gotta try, colonel.
what's the point?
because that ship, the work, that's all i've got left.
i don't have that, l.  i almost forgot.
i promised the xo of the baah pakal i'd help him out.
sir? he's got some obsolete ddg-62 engines that's taking up space on his flight deck.
they're probably crap but i told him that i would have a crew in there to haul them out as soon as possible.
glad to be of help, sir.
good.
madam president, your shuttle's ready. of course.
thank you again for letting me use your quarters.
please.
i wanted to return this.
this was a gift.
never lend a book, i know.
but i've had it far too long.
it belongs in your collection.
i'm late for a quorum meeting. is there a problem?
our computers have been infected by a cylon virus corrupting systems throughout the entire ship.
i've just been notified that this is a prelude to an all-out attack by the cylons.
i assume you've tried to disable it.
mr.
gaeta and the vice president are handling that right now.
i'm not hopeful.
commander, i'm not sure what i can offer you here besides my moral support.
actually, madam president i could use your advice.
you want to what? completely erase our computer drives cold restart the entire ship's system and then restore them using our prewar backups.
leaving us with our  down until we're back online.
the commander will never go for this.
i've already spoken to him, sir.
what did he say?
he's considering it.
it's the only way to destroy the virus.
i thought the commander told you to stay out of this.
i'm sorry, do you want to survive this one or not?
all right, so we calculate a jump and get some distance on these cylon bastards-- no, sir, we can't risk a jump.
all of our systems are compromised, including navigation. the virus could drop us in the middle of a sun.
we're running out of time.
our signal's gonna catch up with the cylon fleet.
if we haven't come up with anything before then-- they'll take control of all of our systems and then they'll have a hundred ways to kill us.
i've just come from seeing our cylon prisoner.
she's offering a possible solution to the problem.
and you're wondering if you can trust her. it took everything i have not to put my hands around her throat.
i can't believe i'm contemplating this.
we both know the cylons are experts at manipulation.
they will do anything to confuse you.
this is not the one who shot me.
can they really be that different from one another?
commander, if you're asking me if it's possible that your judgment's been clouded by your history with this particular cylon model i'd have to say yes.
but we created them.
there's always a chance we might find common ground.
we need to work quickly.
we're on borrowed time.
let her go.
yes, sir.
dee, do you still carry your father's pocketknife?
give it to her. mr.
gaeta, can you set me up with a fiber-optic comm link?
i need broadcast to all frequencies and direct contact to the mainframe.
adama do it.
gaeta sir.
right here, sharon.
thanks.
gaeta dradis.
here they come.
multiple targets.
bearing 371 carom 552.
cylon raiders.
bastards tracked us, all right.
launch vipers.
man  apollo, the raiders are holding, apollo galactica, apollo, raiders are holding formation, repeat, raiders are holding formation, what the hell?
sharon okay, this is how it's going to work. the raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus.
it could take a few seconds.
on my mark, initiate the computer wipe.
miss the window.
the virus takes over every system in the ship.
sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.
right, commander?
what the hell is she doing?
dualla they've made contact, sir.
gaeta it's moving too fast, i can't follow it.
we gotta stop this.
stand by to execute computer wipe on my command.
system is ready, sir.
wipe the hard drives now.
do it.
starbuck my gods, what are they doing?
weapons are still offline.
no dradis.
systems down.
we're looking at a godsdamn bloodbath.
we're defenseless.
hotdog apollo, hotdog, here they come!
all right, copy, hotdog, gods, there must be hundreds of them, cylons are still moving in.
she set us up!  give me your sidearm.
yes, sir.
if they're coming for you, they're gonna be very disappointed.
do it.
tigh what are you waiting for?
this.
what the hell?
we just transmitted a signal.
galactica?
they seem to have lost power, they're drifting out of control!
what the hell?
cylons sent a computer virus.
but we just sent one back.
apollo, this is galactica, kill the bastards.
starbuck yeah! come on, baby, roger that, vipers, weapons free, engage, this is payback,  yeah! how do you like that? you seeing this? apollo got this toaster padlocked, come on!
i got another where that one came from!
starbuck guys, clean them up, come on, let's go, officers.
yes, sir.
take this thing back to its cell.
there you go, chief.
nice to be small, huh? ship's got more than one engine.
get to it.
starbuck we are so damn close.
there has got to be some extra metal lying around that we can use to skin this thing.
floorboards, extra bulkheads, something.
most of it's ticketed for viper repair.
who says you need metal?
carbon composite.
starbuck good call, helo.
it's gonna be hard as hell to see on dradis but the question is, will it fly?
just watch me.
starbuck instruments: in the green, fuel pressure: nominal, apollo, starbuck.
blackbird flight is cleared for launch.
run-up, man  maglock secure, initiate launch sequence, don't blow up on me, you bastard, clear for launch, dualla blackbird is away, will you take it easy?
start slow, you're testing the ship, it's not about the pilot showing off, starbuck who's showing off? apollo gods damn it, what is this?
what are you trying to prove?
i'm not trying to prove anything, you've got to be kidding me,  oh, lords, okay, let's see what this baby can do,   apollo starbuck, where are you?
starbuck, do you hear me? starbuck!
man i'm not,,,, she's gone!
galactica, apollo, i've lost her, i've lost her, dualla no dradis contact, apollo starbuck, where are you?
starbuck, come in, starbuck, do you read?
kara, are you okay? of course, you lost contact.
it's a damn stealth ship, remember?
oh, you,,,,   officer commander on deck.
as you were.
chief tyrol?
this is the blackbird?
yes, ma'am.
madam president, this is an honor.
no, the honor's mine.
it's remarkable.
just a ship, ma'am.
laura you're much too modest.
after what we've been through it would be very easy to give up, to lose hope.
but not here.
not today.
this is more than a ship, chief.
this is an act of faith.
it is proof that despite all we've lost we keep trying.
and we will get through this, all of us, together.
i promise.
commander.
ahem, madam president this was supposed to be a surprise but, well.
thank you. if you'll do us the honors, madam president. of course.
okay.
kidding.
hell of an idea, using carbon composites.
man it was a good job.
nice work.
that was lovely.
they wanted to do that for you.
thank you. none of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the cylon.
i took your advice, met on common ground.
what was that?
we both wanted to live.
previously on battlestar galactica i feel like i'm abandoning my post.
time to pack it in, saul.
you know it.
more than half the crew's down on new caprica already.
we're not really doing too much up here anymore.
good luck.
oh, my gods.
it's a cylon fleet.
they found us.
there's only way that this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of new caprica.
you brought 'em over, saul.
not all of them.
what about us? there is no us.
all right?
there is nothing here.
do you get that?
nothing!
lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?
i'm doing fine, thank you. you're not still frakking dualla, are you?
i am proud to serve with you, lieutenant.
and to call you my wife.
starbuck i'm in a different place now.
i just want to hurt someone, and it might as well be you.
okay, let's roll.
unh! apollo, you got him!
you got him!
crowd oh! crowd oh! that was exactly what i needed.
glad to be of service.
grab the rope!
damn it.
looking for this? ahem.
yeah.
kara, i want you back.
i want our marriage back.
i want a real marriage.
and what if i'm just not ready for that?
i don't know.
then i guess you'll never be.
maybe because i'm not what you really want after all.
i'm late for the dance.
don't forget your boots on the way out, sammy.
kat get that right up, lee! if it isn't the fighting agathons, huh? starbuck, late to the party as usual.
at least i got here in time to watch you kick the cag's ass.
lee, you got him.
you just got to keep your right up.
he's a tough little frakker, i'll give him that.
he's springing like he's got it in for me.
stay off the ropes.
helo all right.
stick and move.
just stay off the ropes.
all right, you got him.
well, look at that. a couple months ago you would've had to roll him into this ring.
well, not anymore.
you know, with a cooler head, he might have half a chance.
come on!
keep it up!
tigh come on.
hey, hey, i'm all right.
put 'em up.
fisher!
fisher, you're up! good fight.
bit off a little more than you can chew, huh? oh, come on, lee.
don't be that way.
stick around.
the night's young.
well, i guess then you'll just have to enjoy it without me.
pulling your tags out so soon?
i'm done, kara.
i'm not.
now who's biting off more than they can chew, captain?
not me from where i'm standing, major.
excuse me.
ahem.
battlestar galactica309 i can't believe the progress they've made.
you should've seen it a month ago.
well, i'd still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night then muck around in this muck.
bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight. he said yes. he approved the transfer?
starbuck you two just don't know how to keep a secret, do you?
so what, are you guys here to see baltar put a shovel in the ground?
join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow.
aw, it's such a load of crap.
there's an open bar.
really?
see, now why didn't you say so? lee, you gotta let your better half do the talking.
she gets right to the point.
let's go find us a better tomorrow.
excuse us.
didn't expect to find you playing in the sand.
it's not sand.
it's allu.
twelve cylon models seven are known four live in secre one will be revealed previously on battlestar galactica.
the threes,the d'annas.
they were boxed after the battle on the algae planet.
why? d'anna saw the faces of the final five.
but if we unbox her,she can reveal their identities to us. the final five have been to earth.
if we help find them,they can help us get there.
so what could possibly motivate us to trust you now? the boxing facility resides within the cylon resurrection hub.
this hub controls the functions of every resurrection ship.
you destroy the hub,cylons lose their ability to download.
the hybrid on the baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.
we're going to talk to the hybrid.
and why would you require my presence?
because you're in my visions.
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship, along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
hub's gone.
we're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.
baseship fragments.
the president's baseship was destroyed.
it's a different baseship.
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away, well,that sounds a lot like suicide,dad.
why are you doing this? because i can't live without her.
two days ago plug it in.
i need to talk to it.
let god's will be done.
shut up.
it's time to get some answers.
jump! elosha.
oh,my gods.
filters.
filters the sublime elevation.
why did it jump?
where are we?
i'm more concerned about why we're here.
control.
filters.
why don't i talk to the hybrid?
find out why. she can just do that.
she can just jump! will you walk with me? galactica.
itwhat's going on?
it's empty.
it is feels bigger this way,doesn't it?
it's so quiet.
it's strange.
a lot of things are strange.
in search of a home called earth wing beats of a dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow.
six is back in the stream.
that's unusual.
to jump again so quickly.
what do you think it means?
look,it knows me. it trusts me.
i think.
i think it even likes me,'cause i you're getting information from this liquid?
the hybrid is disorganized.it's
panicking.
i don't know why.
tell me.
why are you jum the ship? the six. the six who went among the makers is no longer.
end of line.
back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream.
the six.
she means natalie,the six who was our leader.
she's either been hurt or killed back on galactica.
that's why the hybrid's panicking.
so she's upset.
okay,fine.
can you.
calm her down?can
you tell her to jump back? it doesn't work like that.
she makes her own decisions.
and we can't unplug her because now she's wired herself into life support.
all right,then why don't we give this a go? hey.
hey,stop jum the ship,all right?
calm your mind.
cease countdown,cease countdown.
circulation,ventilation,control.
filters.
filters.the
sublime elevation did you see that? i just opened myself up to it on a spiritual level jump! don't you just hate these people?
no.
oh,but you don't love them either.
the people in this room are the closest thing you've got to family,and you.
you've been their president.
watch them try to comfort each other.
at least you haven't taken that away from them.
yet.
you didn't rob them of their empathy.
yet.
you just don't make room for people anymore.
you don't love people. is that clear enough? practical enough for you,madam president?
i think we're going towards the resurrection hub.
i think the mission is still on.
you sure there's no eta at the hub? no,the hub is jum and our hybrid's jum after it.
sometimes we're showing up six hours after it's moved on.
sometimes,like,six minutes.
and one time it'll be within one jump-length and we'll catch it.
yeah,but we don't know when.
so we'll have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.
they're gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first viper.
hell,they'll read our electronics.
yeah,if we could only mask that.
go in cold.
no electronics at all.
we'll send the vipers out dead,towed by cylon birds.
they'll never see it coming.
take out the hub's jump drive,then settle in for the long fight.
yeah,good,okay,okay. but you and me,we've got to get onto the hub in the middle of that mess and try to find d'anna.
we can do this.
no,i-i don't know.
it's crazy,isn't it?
we're putting ourselves right where the action is.
it's not a great plan.
there's no time.
hey,let me help you.
athena,my wife,she learned to do that.
she never did that when i met her.
what?
i got curious about athena.
about her and hera and you.
so i accessed her.
her memories from her last download.
you have her memories.
yeah,and they're mine now too.
they're as real as my own.
i know this must feel like a violation of trust or something, but i don't i don't want it to be strange,okay?
right.
right,sure.
madam president?
sir? hope i didn't wake you.
uh,come in.
thank you for the use of youryour raptor.
i needed some familiar surroundings.
don't worry.i'll
give it back to lt. pike the second you need it.
about that.
this mission,it's very risky.
if there's even a chance that we can go in and blow up that hub and end cylon resurrection for all cylons forever, we must take it.
i cannot back away from that.
yes,sir.
if and when d'anna comes back from the dead,bring her to me.
i think the cylons think that she'll be interrogated by both groups together.
i'm sure they do.
bring her to me.
she knows the identities of the five cylons in our fleet.
it is a matter now of human security, and i will not let the cylons have audience to that discussion.
i want to talk to her alone.
yes,sir.
good.
resurrection hub welcome home,d'anna.
you told me i'd never have to go through this again.
i lied.
you thought you were putting me away forever.
so what changed?
war.
a genuine cylon civil war.
ones and fours and fives against twos and sixes and eights that objected to your retirement.
now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us.
all in your name.
boomer's an eight.
shouldn't she be on the other side?
boomer's my pet eight.
she's seen the light of reason.
and an eight can make a passionate ally.
till she sees something shiny.
why'd you bring me back anyway?
i brought you back to heal us,sister,and end this shameful war.
since cylon pilots don't use call signs, we're gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.
that's a relief.
you address them,use that number,okay?
should've scrubbed this frakkin' mission.
hey,everyone,listen up.
now these heavy raiders aren't like the other raiders.
they aren't gonna make any hinky moves on their own.
they're under the control of their pilots. the cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.
oh,now there are tiny pilots inside of them?
we do our jobs.
training is just as good as yours.
oh,yeah?
twenty-some of you i've taken out weren't that good.
redwing.
redwing! now let's talk about the surprise element.
first wave of vipers are gonna ride in,engines cold,dradis and comm off,okay?
you're gonna come in towed by cables from the heavy raiders.
we're rigging 'em up now.
captain,don't now,i mean,if they're all tied together here, kissing their gasholes so to speak, and they tap on the brakes, we're gonna smash right in the back of them.
they won't.
it'll work,you guys.really.
when you're close enough,the cable's gonna disconnect.
we're mounting small explosive charges to cut it.
hold it,hold it.
we cut the cable,right?
cylon pilots cut the cable.
then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on.
you're gonna be gunning directly at the hub's ftl.
then it's an all-out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.
yeah,so if the cylons don't lift up,and then we're toast,right?
no,look,i'm serious.
hey,hey!
pilots! you've flown with cylons.
you've flown with athena.
you put your life in her hands and she hasn't betrayed you.
well,i am the same as her.
now all of these cylons here,all of these people,they're pilots like you.
and they're gonna be out in the soup with you taking out other cylons, just like athena does every time she's asked to.
and when that hub is taken out,all of their lives will be at risk.
just like yours.
so you might want to think about how you're gonna work together.
because we're all dead if you don't.
moving on.
just go and ask it already.
i've been told that you said something about an opera house, and i because it seems pointless.
look,there was an opera house.
an opera house.
are you listening to me? apparently i was in the opera house.
i had a vision.
i was chasing after a little girl.
i came to a door.
i saw dr.baltar and the six take the child.
she's not listening.
protect the child.
she said,protect the child.
that's what caprica said.
you told me i was the one holding the child, so obviously i was the one protecting the child,wasn't i? in the opera house no,no,no.
it wasn't at all clear what you were doing.
let me listen.
booting up.
i mean,obviously you've done this a thousand times before.
well,i'm just doing the same thing you're doing.
no,you're not actually.
no,you're not.
because if you'll watch what i'm doing, what i'm doing is i'm actually focusing on her,all right?
now tell us what happened in the opera house now,all right?
oh,the only thing you're doing is yelling.
such a format will close the doors.
close the door.no,no,open the door.open the door.
i want to open the door!
do it again,do it again,do it again!
i'm going for a walk.
love to see you do any better.
all right,i'll do it.
open the door!
three! the three is online.
the three is online.
the three is online.
the three is online.
accessing data.
the three is d'anna.
loading data.
d'anna is online.
oh,d'anna's in a body.
d'anna's back in a body.
booting upjump!
why are we doing this again?
i don't want to see this again.
the ancients used to say a people is only as strong as the body of its leader.
if i follow that thought,are you saying that humanity died because i died? if you're my subconscious,i've gotta say you're a little full of myself.
humanity didn't die because you did. the ancients,they got a lot of things wrong.
the body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader.
but the soul and the spirit might be.
oh,i see,so you're only laying morality at my feet.
well,that's okay.
i can take that.
i mean,there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.
you're thinking of gaius baltar.
then i dug into the stump and pulled rocks from the ground until my fingers bled.
i collected seeds from the few fruits the island offered, and planted them in long,straight furrows,like the ranks of soldiers.
when i finished,i looked at what i had done.
i did not see a garden.
i saw a scar.
this island had saved my life,and i had done it no service.
i can see a real hierarchy around here.
and i have to tell you,you're on the lower end of the scale,my friend.
yes,you are.
which is odd when you think about the cylon god they told you about god,didn't they?
i'm not even really sure if the hybrid was referring to d'anna,but if it's true.
it certainly would make it easier.
how so? well,we.
wouldn't have to find a.
find a body.
yes,good.
okay.
go get her and bring her here.
something else? it's just once you have what she knows, i can't help feeling like you could try to keep earth for humans only.
and i just madam president,that doesn't seem what?
honest.
you're supposed to be conducting a fair deal here, and instead you're taking d'anna off by yourself.
taking what she knows.
slow down,captain.
at best,d'anna knows conoce the identities of the cylons in our fleet.
and at best,they know a way to earth.
so you're not denying you'd keep the way to earth to yourself if you could.
i'm not saying that's true.
i will say that if the cylons had the option,that's exactly,exactly what they would do.
no,i don't think so.
not the sharons,the eights.
captain.
you are not married to the entire production line.
i cannot afford to be sentimental right now, and i cannot afford you to be sentimental either.
if you can't do this job,find me someone who can. what is that?
i think we're there.
something's going on.
another baseship,unscheduled. you've gotta speak to the twos and sixes and eights and tell them they've gone too far.
no.
why don't you ask about the final five? you never ask about them.
that's because i don't believe we're meant to know them.
well,i'll tell you.
i will tell you.
i'll start shouting out their names.
why do you risk it?
are you going to help end this war or are you useless?
come on,let's get this carpool started.
now! cut the frakkin' cable now,you frakkin' bastard!
oh,the inhibition's been lifted.
oh,i sense it.
it's the rebel baseship.
i think they're gonna attack.
they're gonna blow the hub.
that would be mass murder.
death would be permanent for all of us.
they've gone insane.
permanent death?
well,that makes this all the more meaningful.
helo,we've blown their ftl.
that hub's not going anywhere.
okay,take us down.
well,he's your god as well.
and god doesn't want any of his creations to be.
slaves.
not that you're a slave.
exactly.
go.
this place is gonna go.
grab her.
run! hardball,pike.i'm
hit.
my attitude control is down,and i can't even program any frakkin' ordnance.
pike,hardball.
man,don't jump.
you'll never make it to galactica.
you know how many jumps that is? i'm out of here.
okay,i'm jum back home.
karl.
come on,let's go.
go! there was this dog,see,and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout.
and the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it.
i know.pathetic.pathetic,isn't
it?
put him over there.
wait.
easy,smith.easy,easy.
okay.
find out what's going on! yes,sir.
thank you. okay.
thank you,thank you.
good.
okay,wait.
okay.
sorry.
you have thisyou have this big hole in your hide,as cottle would say.
okay.
all right.
i'm gonna do this again.
thank you. it's the least i can do.
i think you're gonna live.
as usual.
you know something?
what?
you're very pretty.
man,that morpha worked fast.
still.
do you know why i'm so serene right now? you're doped out of your mind?
because i know god.
you need god,laura.
really,you'd be a different woman.
i know god.
therefore,i know myself.
truth is.
i was harboring the most awful,desperate guilt.
a heavy,dark.
unimaginable.
soul-breaking guilt.
now it's gone.
now it's gone,it's.
been transformed into i have been transformed.
what was your guilt about?
i have no guilt.
what was your guilt about?
i gave the access codes to the cylons.
they wiped out most of humanity. of course,i didn't know that's what i was doing at the time exactly, but that's what i did.
and when i realized what i had done,the magnitude.
in that moment,i was saved.
i was loved.
by god.
looking back.
i think i was rewarded.
rewarded.
pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity.
nobody blames the flood.
a flood is a force of nature.
through the flood,mankind is rejuvenated,born again.
i was another flood,you see.
i blamed myself.
i blamed myself.
but god made the man that made that choice.
god made us all perfect.
and in that thought,all my guilt flies away.
flies away like a bird.
i can give you that peace,laura,that freedom.
pray with me.
pray with me.
okay.
thank you. okay.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
it's all right.
you're fine.
don't do this to me.
don't do this to me,please.
we have d'anna on board.
we are clear of the hub.
commence nuclear strike.
repeat,nuclear strike is a go.
and with a whimper,every cylon in the universe begins to die.
yes,that's right.
and it's a good thing,d'anna.
na because now there's no difference.
we can all start trusting each other.
don't do this to me.
don'tdon't do this to me.
don't do this to me,please.
please.
no.
i'm not saying baltar's done more good than harm in the universe.
he hasn't.
the thing is,the harder it is to recognize someone's right to draw breath, the more crucial it is.
if humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving, it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.
a bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.
what do you want from me here?
laura.
just love someone.
love.
you go.
you go.
you go to your rest now.
i'm not gonna be selfish anymore.
you go.
rest.
no.
no,please,no.
stop bleeding.
stop the bleeding,stop the bleeding.
okay,good.
don't go.
all right,we've gotta get d'anna to the control room.
nano,that's not the plan.
what?
what plan?
interesting.
please don't go,gaius.
please.
i don't know how all right,put it in.
i have to take her directly to the president.
no one else.
that wasn't the deal.
i'm just doing what she told me to do,okay? double dealing.
it's very human.
you never got that,eight.
no more.
no more,don't go.
please don't die.
live,please.don't
go.
i'm not saying i agree.
i'm saying it's my orders.
so i pretty much just made a prize fool of myself,didn't i? trust.
can we go find the president now? gaius?
gaius,it's me. the hub's been destroyed.
good.
don't let anyone in here.
whatever it takes.
thank you. he's injured,but i think he's going to survive.
i think it's gonna be a long time jum back.
i've got time. is that right?
well,you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here.
deceiving your so-called allies.
i suppose you've got some questions for me.
yes,i do.
i'd like to talk about the five cylons in my fleet.
so you know about the final five.
i know they're supposed to know the way to earth.
but you don't know that you're one of them?
your face! oh,it's ridiculous!
no,look,i'm not giving you any names.
not until i feel like i'm safe.
'cause information is all i got,sweetie.
i'm mortal now. in fact,i'm the only three in the whole darn universe.
so i gotta worry about protecting myself.
i'll tell you who the final five are when you take me back to your fleet.
oh,and by the way,laura,i would've said the same thing if you'd have met me with a whole lot of cylons, 'cause i don't trust anyone right now.
so all this deception,complete waste of time.
to remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring, simultaneously release the three tangs while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring.
you lied to me.
did i? i thought i was earning humanity's right to survive.
it's not a vending machine,laura.
you don't save a life,and then cue the celestial trumpets here's the way to earth.
i know.
jump! disorienting,isn't it?
all these little lim steps back.
i like it.
i'm used to it.
every jump brings us a little bit closer to home.
galactica.
my home.
maybe there's something there for me.
maybe even closer.
missed you.
me too.
i love you.
about time.
previously on battlestar galactica: gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her.
how can one of us get that roped in by one of them?
look, chief.
i know how she felt about you.
she loved you.
you know what, i should probably be grateful to you because that freak in her belly could've been mine.
do you have actual memories of,,, being with the chief before the cylon attack?
you're the father of my child.
you're the first in my heart.
and nothing is ever going to change that, all right, here's the deal.
we are going to build a new fighter.
blackbird test flight, cleared for launch.
galactica, apollo, i've lost her, of course, you lost contact.
it's a damn stealth ship, remember?
action stations, action stations, set condition one throughout the ship, this is not a drill, repeat, action stations, action stations, adama well, madam president, looks like you picked a hell of a day for a visit.
this is the commander.
sitrep.
bogey just jumped into dradis range, cbdr.
from the size of it, it's probably a cylon base ship.
cap's on its way to intercept it.
alert the fleet to an emergency jump, i'm on my way with the president.
galactica, apollo, i'm outbound on course to the base star just tag alongside me, i estimate one minute till intercept, dualla roger that, apollo, be advised, alert fighters have launched and will take station on your six in three minutes.
sitrep.
alert fighters launched.
new dradis contact, they're launching raiders.
how long till we jump?
another two minutes.
sir? sir, i'm getting colonial transponders.
colonial?
hell, now they're using our own signals against us.
maybe.
weapons hold.
hold the jump, too.
something up your sleeve, i take it?
all ships, galactica, hold jump.
say again, hold jump.
ship to ship, colonial priority one channel.
send hostile challenge and ld. and put your reply up on the speakers.
attention, unknown vessel.
this is the battlestar galactica, identify yourself or we will fire upon you.
range now 1,700, sir.
man this is the battlestar pegasus to the ship claiming to be the galactica.
please respond, pegasus?
how could that be? the entire fleet was destroyed.
give me direct contact.
pegasus, this is galactica actual.
authenticate identity with recognition codes immediately.
sir.
i'm receiving colonial recognition codes.
they're authentic.
cain galactica, this is pegasus actual, adama, is that you? adm.
cain.
what a pleasure to hear your voice.
cain disengage.
red team, disengage.
red team, disengage.
commander cain i don't know what to say.
this is a miracle.
you took the words right out of my mouth.
step down to condition one throughout the fleet.
apollo galactica apollo, you are not going to believe,,, what i'm looking at out here, it's like a dream.
it is a dream.
man  pegasus raptor 861, galactica.
skids down, mag secure, welcome aboard, admiral, tigh get into ranks, people!
look sharp.
this isn't recess!
come on, the landing party is here.
dress and cover.
nice of you to show up.
couldn't get here too early.
group, attention!
adm.
cain, welcome aboard the galactica, cmdr.
adama it's an honor.
allow me to present to you the president of the colonies, laura roslin.
it's a long story.
welcome.
madam president, pleasure.
on behalf of the officers and the crew of the pegasus,,, it's a pleasure to see all of you.
welcome back to the colonial fleet.
capt.
taylor.
kara thrace.
captain taylor.
admiral.
i'm fairly burning with questions.
i hope you don't mind if i just dive in.
please.
how did you find us?
well, we were tracking a cylon fleet.
we were trying to predict their movements, which seemed rather random initially.
until we realized that they were just jum to systems with natural resources.
so, we began to scout those systems ourselves ho to carry out hit-and-run attacks on their fleet but instead of finding the cylons, we found you.
so, you've been attacking their fleet?
well, you know what they say about the best defense.
how did you avoid the initial cylon attack on the colonies?
i'll have another if you don't mind.
galactica's finest.
beats the hell out of the nickel tour.
thank you. i figured if you'd seen one old battlestar, you'd seen them all.
yeah, well, she's an old one.
i can't believe the cylons didn't kick your ass up one side and down the other in this bucket.
sorry.
and just for that you have to skip this round.
we were docking at scorpion fleet shipyard.
we were getting ready to go in for a three-month overhaul.
most of the crew was getting ready for extended shore leave and family reunions.
xo had the deck.
i was down in my quarters, wrap up some paperwork and getting ready to pack up to go home to tauron.
and that's when the cylons attacked.
they hit the shipyard with three, maybe four nukes.
five ships.
two of them battlestars.
they were destroyed right there.
and by the time i got to back to clc i discovered that i'd lost over 700 men.
my gods.
we were completely defenseless, so i ordered a jump.
to where?
wherever.
nowhere.
just jump.
adama blind jump.
could've ended up anywhere.
gutsy call.
no.
desperate move.
didn't see any other choice.
well, i'm sure you have quite a story to tell yourself.
but i won't make you go through it right this very minute.
you can send up your logs when you get the chance.
yes, sir. is something wrong?
no.
i sometimes forget about the rules of military protocol.
adama adm.
cain is my superior officer.
she will take complete command of the entire fleet.
i was wondering how to broach that topic.
trust me when i say that while the chain of command is strict, it is not heartless.
and neither am l. this is your ship.
and i have no desire to interfere with galactica's internal affairs.
i appreciate it, admiral.
madam president, you look like i just shot your dog.
no, i just.
just the commander and l, we've been through a lot.
excuse me.
madam president? if you'll both excuse me.
admiral, i can't tell you how grateful we are to have you here.
thank you for finding us.
madam president.
the secretary of education?
she's come a long way.
i'm sure.
so tell me about adm.
cain.
officer's discretion. of course.
we were going after what we thought was a little cylon comm relay.
easy target, right?
turns out it wasn't a comm relay at all. it was a staging area.
full of 15 squadrons of raiders.
adm.
cain ordered our xo to attack.
those two were real close.
he'd served with her for years.
but here's the thing he refused the order.
adm.
cain we have a cylon prisoner aboard this ship.
really?
we have one on ours as well.
ours has proven to be an excellent source of intelligence.
she's been very cooperative.
the vice president, dr.
baltar, has been working with her.
tigh what did she do?
she asked for his gun.
shot him in the head with it in front of the whole crew.
and then she turned to me.
what did you do? i ordered the frakking attack, what do you think i did?  no.
no.
i'm just joking.
i'm just kidding, you know. it gives me no pleasure to have to take command, bill.
i want you to know that.
don't give it a moment's thought, admiral.
is this a scorecard?
you guys put scorecards on the side of your ships?
like you don't keep score.
you don't see me painting them on the side iike i'm bragging to the whole frakking universe.
that's 48 kills right there.
that's special.
do you have caps and t-shirts, too?  where's the galactica cag? right here.
let's hear the rundown on this squadron of yours, captain.
i see you don't keep track of your kills.
you should start.
encourages morale, gets the competition going, esprit de corps, well, that's one philosophy.
it's adm.
cain's philosophy.
that means it's your philosophy now, captain.
the name of my commander is adama.
it should be pretty easy to remember, 'cause it's my name.
yeah.
i'll keep that in mind, daddy's boy.
let's see your ordnance lists.
they made me head of the cylon branch and my main focus is on cylon detection.
we have our own cylon prisoner.
i'd like you to examine it as soon as possible.
see if you can glean anything from it.
i wonder who the cylon will turn out to be? a stranger, a familiar face a trusted friend who suddenly turns out to be the enemy?
did you hear what i just said?
yes.
i'd be really.
i'd be very happy to examine the prisoner.
commander.
admiral.
admiral.
i am so sorry.
that is one ugly baby.
excuse me? do you mind if i take a look around?
i'm laird, pegasus deck chief.
yeah.
tyrol.
thanks for sending over these parts.
yeah, look at whatever you like.
ddg-62's.
i'll be.
i designed these engines.
i thought they phased them out over 10 years ago.
you're an aeronautical engineer?
yeah, i was.
then the war happened, and i got drafted to being the deck chief on pegasus, so you're really a civilian?
how'd that happen?
i was on the scylla, and we got picked up by the pegasus, things happen.
mind if i crawl around inside here?
i heard you designed this yourself.
i'd love to see how you did it.
yeah, go ahead.
pegasus has been resupplying galactica,,, from its own reserve, for military operations.
which completely support.
but when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet?
adm.
cain has assured me that those supplies are on their way.
well, at least she's taking your phone calls.
i can't even get her to answer mine.
i'll bring it to her attention.
how are you doing with all this?
she outranks me.
it's as simple as that.
you know, if president adar stepped off that raptor, i'd be elated.
grateful to have someone take over, and yet.
i don't want go to the and yet part.
i've been taking orders my entire career.
this is no different.
well, then, commander, thank you. we would appreciate all the help you can give us.
you shall receive it.
sounds like you were both drunk.
no question.
but he wasn't lying, i can tell you that right now.
well, i hope you won't jump to conclusions.
wait for all of the facts.
context matters.
context? that woman shot an officer right in front of the crew.
we shot down an entire civilian transport with over it says so right there.
that was completely different.
and we don't know there were people on that ship.
which is why i hope the admiral reads the complete log and understands the context.
we should ask adm.
cain for her logs just so we can put her in context.
wouldn't that be nice?
don't get too close.
it killed seven of my crew.
you want my s to come in with you? feeling scared, gaius?
want the big, bad soldiers to protect you from the mean old cylon prisoner?
no, i think we'll be just fine.
thank you. oh, my god.
no.6 my god, gaius.
it's me.
look what they've done to her. open the door.
now, please.
she must've struggled.
she must have fought back.
that doesn't justify this.
stop it.
hello.
hello.
can you hear me? she's obviously been abused.
tortured.
balter yes.
but there's no obvious sign of head trauma.
voluntary eye movements suggest conscious thought.
can't you stop being a scientist for one moment and look at the abused woman lying there in front of you? now, listen.
i know this must be very difficult for you.
don't patronize me.
i'm not patronizing you.
i'm trying to reason with you.
if i'm going to help her, i have to understand her first.
will you help her, gaius?
i will do everything i can.
after all she is remarkably similar to someone i care about a great deal.
i think it would be best if you left us alone for a time.
it suffered no serious head injuries, therefore no physical damage to its neural pathways or cognitive reasoning centers.
but it's quite clearly traumatized.
which would suggest that its current condition is psychological in nature.
had you thought of that?
no. it shows that the cylon consciousness is just as susceptible to the same pressures and cleavages as the human psyche and can be manipulated in the same fashion.
simply put, admiral, you have already used the stick.
it's time to use a carrot.
please give the doctor whatever he needs.
aye, sir.
commander, having read your logs it appears that you've been through quite an ordeal.
we've had our moments.
well, you did yourselves proud.
thank you, admiral.
as i told you, we were tracking a cylon fleet when we found galactica, and now that i've had a chance to compare their route to your ship's logs it's quite clear that they've been following you.
our recon so far tells us that the fleet is composed of two base ships about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
it's this large ship here that i'm interested in.
what's its function?
is it a commanding control ship? a raider factory?
possibly.
whatever it is, the cylons are protecting it.
this is what i'd call a tempting target.
and here i was getting ready to do a whole song and dance about combining resources for a joint strike mission.
any chance of hitting the cylons where it hurts.
my pleasure.
i'll have apollo coordinate with your cag.
which leads me to the next subject, commander.
i'm going to integrate the crews.
and i'm starting by reassigning capt.
adama to the pegasus air wing.
i have a team that works very well together.
let's just cut through it, shall we? after reviewing your logs, it is my judgment that having your son as galactica cag has been a grave mistake.
he's been insubordinate, even mutinous.
and these are direct quotes from your logs, by the way.
and i dare say, he's not the only one with disciplinary problems.
there's a kara thrace who habitually strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders.
this lt.
agathon has fraternized with and evidently impregnated an enemy agent.
let's not even discuss your xo.
so there is a complete list of transfers.
i thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
i'm saving your command, bill.
you're way too close to these officers.
and it's blinding you to their weaknesses and to the damage that they're doing to unit cohesion and then to morale.
i don't agree.
well, that is certainly your right.
you have your orders.
transfer to pegasus? why the frak should we do that?
because those are your orders.
we can't just let her come here and change our entire roster on the eve of a major cylon operation.
she's trying to break up the team 'cause their cag has a stick up his ass-- that's enough! you're officers, act like it.
she's given you an order.
you will carry it out.
permission to speak freely?
you may not.
we've all gotten used to bending the rules, having our way ietting things slide.
well, that's over.
you wear the uniform, you will accept the rules that go with it.
you've been transferred.
pack your gear and report to the pegasus cag.
dismissed.
this is a photo recon mission, we are interested in one cylon ship in particular,,, which is larger than anything we've encountered before, analysis to date suggests they will be in this star system next, we will hide behind this moon,,, which has an abnormally large magnetotail and will mask our dradis signatures, we'll power down, hide near the surface, wait for the fleet to pass by, starbuck, you have something to add? your plan sucks.
and the cylons aren't stupid.
that moon's a blind spot.
they'll never go near it.
you really want to get close you got to use the stealth ship we constructed aboard galactica, the homemade tin can? stinger that's enough, starbuck, you're off this mission, whiplash, thumper, get your optical gear ready, apollo, you'll pilot the raptor with me, your jacket says you qualified in one, remember how to fly it?
yes, sir.
good, dismissed,  they expect us to take this lying down?
now you're flying a frakking raptor?
it's humiliating.
a surveillance package?
go get the blackbird.
take some pretty pictures of our cylon ship.
copy that.
cheers, everybody.
all yeah!
where's the blackbird?
a lt.
thrace took it out.
she said adm. cain ordered a performance check out.
what?
gage hey, chief.
you deserve a frakking medal.
we haven't seen booze for months.
this place is a frakking party!
vireem i heard you guys even got yourselves a cylon.
heard she's a hot one, too.
get me some of that cylon stuff.
a little of the, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
hey, you know what, that's enough, guys.
just shut up.
sensitive.
you got a soft spot for the little robot girl, do you?
who the hell are you?
remember when thorne put that please disturb sign up on the brig there?
gage i got in line twice.
i hear that.
remember she was just lying there with that blank look on her face, like.
hey, do you mind?
man  ooh, frisky that hurts.
what is the function of this ship?
i don't know.
here, take a closer look.
what makes it so important?
why would two base stars be tasked to protect it?
i don't know.
do you think thorne will give us a chance at this one, too? no, i heard him say he's gonna have to break her in a little first.
who the hell's this thorne?
lt.
thorne, sir.
cylon interrogator.
rides them hard and keeps them talking.
your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
hee-haw.
think about it.
we need to go.
what the frak?
okay.
no! move it!
get out of the way! move!
get out of the way.
get off her! get off her, now!  motherfrakker! freeze!
don't either of you frakking move!
don't move!
don't either of you frakking move!
don't move!
get down! on your knees.
hands behind your head.
now! hands behind your head.
do it now.
do it!
he's dead.
pilot pegasus, raptor 923.
we've cleared galactica,,, and are en route with prisoners and the body of lt.
thorne.
eta to pegasus three minutes.
adama the assault happened here, they should face a court martial on galactica, commander, i am the senior convening authority present.
and they'll be tried on pegasus, they're my men.
one of my men is dead.
fine.
we both have strong feelings about the case.
adama that only underlines the need for an impartial trial, you mean an independent tribunal?
because according to your logs, commander,,, you dissolved an independent tribunal when you didn't like the verdict, and if i'm not mistaken, chief tyrol was on trial there as well.
that was a different time.
yes, indeed it was.
i'll be in touch, commander.
thank you. thank you. now, get out.
the food is yours.
it's not a trick.
i'm not gonna take it away at the last second.
you know, l. i'm just going to talk right now.
i don't expect you to say anything.
back on caprica, before the attack.
and sometimes i forget there was a world before the attack.
i knew someone, a woman unlike any other woman i'd ever known.
she was unique.
beautiful.
clever.
intensely sensual.
when she wasn't in my bed she was in my thoughts.
she was a cylon.
and she changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way in that i have quite literally never stopped thinking about her. because i love her. to this very day, i love her. and she looks exactly like you.
my name is gaius baltar.
and i'm here to help you.
check me on these jump coordinates.
sorry.
jump coordinates verified.
you seem a little distracted, captain.
something i should know about?
two of my friends just got arrested and charged with treason.
i suggest you file that under not your problem.
we have a recon mission to perform.
i need your head in the game.
right.
pegasus, blue team, jump coordinates set and verified.
ready to ftl.
we will jump in 10 minutes on my mark.
mark.
cally any word on the chief, sir? he's gonna have to stand trial.
he's a good man, sir.
i know.
i'll do every-- man  attention, cmdr, adama, contact the cic asap, adama.
i just talked to fisk.
court martial's over.
over?
when did it start?
i don't know, but they've been found guilty on all counts.
she's going to execute them both for murder and treason.
i want a marine strike team in a raptor in five minutes.
prepare to launch alert fighters.
we have work to do.
sir.
woman  pegasus, galactica, please secure channel.
cmdr.
adama would like to speak to adm.
cain.
go ahead, sir, you told me they'd get a fair trial.
what kind of a trial could they have possibly had? cain i assure you, i heard them out, i weighed their statements against those of the s and i took into consideration their service records and commendations. it was a difficult decision, commander, but i dare say, it was a fair one.
they have the right to have their case heard by a jury.
i am a flag officer on detached service during a time of war, regulations give me broad authority in this matter.
launch the fighters.
you can quote me whatever regulation you'd like.
i'm not gonna let you execute my men.
i highly suggest you reconsider that statement, commander.
admiral, galactica is launching vipers and a raptor.
commander, why are you launching vipers?
please arrange for chief tyrol and lt.
agathon to be handed over to my marines as soon as they arrive.
i don't take orders from you.
call it whatever you like.
i'm getting my men.
you are making such a mistake.
i'm getting my men.
action stations.
action stations, admiral, this will spiral out of control fast.
launch the alert vipers.
adama has taken us over the line.
he's left with me with no choice.
launch the alert vipers.
previously on battlestar galactica: i just finished the post-flight on starbuck's viper.
this thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
it's time to get some answers.
plug it in.
jump! president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship, along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away that sounds a lot like suicide, dad.
why are you doing this? because i can't live without her.
we have d'anna onboard.
we are clear of the hub.
commence nuclear strike.
so you know about the final five.
i know they're supposed to know the way to earth.
i've gotta worry about protecting myself.
i will tell you when you take me back to your fleet.
i love you.
about time.
hey there, mr.
prez.
heard you were here.
temple of aurora.
on earth.
at least the way pythia described it.
we'll get there.
walk those halls together.
yeah, pretty to think so.
this roslin's stuff?
it's weird for them to not be here.
no one sits in his chair.
tigh can't even look at it.
you know, the scariest thing my mom used to tell me when i was a kid, was your father is waiting for you in the study.
i'd knock on the door, make the long walk across the room to that desk.
you know, leoben said something to me when he was holding me in that doll house on new caprica.
that children are born to replace their parents.
for children to reach their full potential their parents have to die.
we rejoin your fleet in less than an hour.
then we will return your final five to you.
four.
there are four in your fleet.
four.
where's the fifth?
i want the four in your fleet.
it'd be easier if you'd just tell us who they are.
easier because you could kill them.
why would we do that?
they know the way to earth.
we need them.
she's right.
we all want the same thing.
if we cooperate we cooperated on new caprica, brother.
it didn't work out well.
i'm going to hold your people hostage until the final four are safely aboard this ship.
you need to stand down, bill.
come on.
trust me.
stand down.
pass the word around.
stack arms.
i've already had an eight prepare a raptor, so we'll launch as soon as we come out of the jump.
oh, and, admiral, you'll be coming along with me to galactica.
i'm not going.
bill, go.
if the cylons get the four, they get earth.
you can't let this happen, even if you're to blow this ship to hell.
oh, godsdamn it.
i got it, felix.
yeah.
thanks.
mr.
gaeta, do you wish to be relieved?
good to go.
dradis contact.
incoming, bearing 1-8-5, carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.
what do we got? cylon baseship.
another contact, same bearing.
it's a raptor.
our people are back, sir.
maybe she won't be able to identify us.
gods, it'sit's good to have you back.
it's good to be home.
the goods news is that your president, laura roslin, is alive and well, as are your crewmates.
she wants the four cylons that are in this fleet.
she's gonna hold our people hostage until she gets them.
you don't have to do anything except stay out of the way.
i'm already in contact with them.
now that they realize there's nothing to fear and that we only want to love and protect them, they should find a way of joining us.
i just ask that you don't interfere with any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.
so your plan is you take these four cylons and then you head off to earth, leaving us behind?
now that's up to them.
all right.
if these four cylons want to come to you, they're free to do so.
i will not stop them.
do you agree with this, admiral?
agreed.
well, then i will await them on the baseship.
laura roslin needs her medication.
and i need to make sure that she's all right.
i'm gonna go with them.
no.
we can't give them any more hostages.
the colonel's right.
i served under roslin for two years.
my place is by her side.
another hostage isn't gonna change the equation.
all right, go.
thank you. i backed your play, and now what?
starbuck goes to work on a plan to get our people back by force.
if we can't stop the cylons from reaching the baseship, laura roslin wants it destroyed.
half our guys are over there.
it's your call, mr.
president.
roslin's right.
we lose those four, we lose earth.
if everything goes south, we destroy the baseship and everyone on it.
com/bbs=- com/bbs=- sync: rocket so the prisoners were here, but d'anna has to know that you brought me in on this.
if she's moved the prisoners, it'll mean a compartment by compartment fight.
and if they open fire on the civilian fleet while we're boarding?
they could wipe out the human race right there and then.
that's why we need to make sure that our raptors are already out there with their nukes cocked and locked there's gotta be other options.
yeah, those frakkin' four could give themselves up.
brothers and sisters, this is a great day for us.
one of our lost siblings has arrived.
she's one of the final five? i saw her in my vision.
now she's come home.
laura there's been something i've been meaning to say to you.
i wanted to thank you. and for what?
essentially for not murdering me.
that can't have been an easy decision to make.
but i love living.
i love living, and i wanted to thank you for saving my life.
i wouldn't be so grateful if i were you.
you should know that i told the admiral that if d'anna doesn't back down, he should blow the ship to pieces.
you what? she's in here.
madame president.
gaius.
tory.
sit down.
i brought you your medication.
oh, my gods.
how did you do that?
i came back with d'anna to be with my people.
because you're one of the five.<>/i
you're one of the final five.
d'anna saw her. in a vision.
i knew it.
maybe not on a conscious level, but subconsciously, i always knew there was something.
you had no idea, did you?
no.
might be worth pondering what else you've been wrong about.
tory, wait.
you're right.
i'm wrong.
okay.
you are one of the revered final five, and as such, the cylons will listen to you. is that not right?
so, tory, please go to d'anna and try to convince her to back down and release all the hostages.
i'm done taking orders from you.
oh, mr.
president, there has been a change of plans.
i've just executed the first of the colonial hostages.
another will follow every quarter hour until our people come home.
all right, listen to me.
you're not giving us a chance.
we are cooperating.
she terminated the transmission.
all right then, admiral, you're a go for the rescue mission.
if it fails, destroy the baseship.
yes, mr.
president.
all right, put these pilots in their cockpits.
check all systems, and let's put these birds in the tubes.
got it, chief.
there you go.
apu won't spin up.
there's gotta be a short, and damned if i can find it.
but i set some guys tracking on it, but galen, you with me? you all know that we have a baseship out there with our people on it.
it is our job to get them back alive.
so speed is the only thing we have on our side.
they're no doubt expecting us to try for a breakout, so we have to get in under their reaction time, which is damn fast.
raptor flights two and six under athena will be our breaching force.
they will be carrying our assault teams.
what's the matter?
i'm hearing it again.
all right.
anyone know what the frak we're doing here?
i don't know.
i just felt compelled.
it's something about this viper.
like what? you checked every rivet and washer on that bird, and you didn't find squat.
yeah, well, something brought us here.
something's changed.
i just don't know what it is.
maybe kara can help.
she flew this thing to earth and back.
well, go find her.
see what she can tell you.
but hurry up. a lot of good people are gonna die.
so where are you going?
bill, you gotta scrub this mission.
what the hell are you doing here?
you're supposed to be in the cic. the cylons will kill every godsdamn hostage before we put one pair of boots aboard their ship.
laura roslin will be the next to die, bill.
i'm looking for options.
you got one?
yeah.
i should've told you when i first found out, but i didn't have the guts.
what's wrong with you, saul?
remember back at the nebula when i told you about that frakkin' music?
i thought it was in the ship.
i was wrong.
it was a signal.
some kind of crazy, frakked-up cylon signal switched me on.
i can't turn it off.
switched you on.
like boomer.
i'm one of the five.
the five.
one of the cylons d'anna's after.
quit frakkin' with me.
colonel, i've known you for 30 years.
i told you.
i didn't find out until the nebula.
think about this.
when i met you, you had hair.
i never heard of a cylon aging.
doesn't mean they don't.
before the attack on the colonies, we didn't know skinjobs existed.
turns out there's another kind of cylon we didn't know about, and i'm one of them.
on new caprica, you were in captivity.
they did something to you.
theyan implant, a post-hypnotic suggestion that makes you feel this way.
let's go talk to doc cottle listen to me! it is not a delusion.
it is not a chip in my head.
i am a cylon.
i've fooled you for months now.
i didn't want to, but i did.
get your hands off of me.
if i'd had the guts to airlock myself when i first found out, we wouldn't be in this mess.
but that's the way out.
not this suicidal attack.
i am one of the final five.
d'anna will back down if you threaten to flush me out an airlock.
dad, dad.
dad, listen.
no one suspected.
no one.
not with his record, what he did on new caprica.
his eye, what happened to his wife come on, let's get up.
what have i done?
all the people i've sent to die.
for what? for what? for earth.
there is no earth.
it's a frakkin' joke.
there is no earth.
okay, dad, listen to me.
listen to me! pull it together.
i can't.
yes, you can.
come on.
i can't.
yes, you can.
i can't i can't kill him.
i can't kill the bastard.
i can't.
okay, okay, dad.
i can't.
it'sit's gonna be okay.
i can't it's gonna be okay.
i'lli'll take care of it.
i can't.
i'll take care of it.
you mother-frakker.
who are the others?
where's the old man?
right where you put him.
mr.
president, it's the cic.
d'anna's on the line.
this is the president.
mr.
president, you're running out of time.
no, you are.
it's your turn to listen.
if you harm another one of my people, you so much as blacken one of their eyes, and i flush saul tigh out of the launch tube.
we have no wish for further bloodshed.
may i speak with the admiral?
no, you deal with me.
you have ten minutes to release my people or you can kiss one of your precious final five good-bye.
you want to save the fleet, i need the others, and i need them now.
it's sitting here the same way it has been for months.
what made you think something was happening?
hard to explain.
you know, it's just a feeling.
yeah, i've got a feeling too.
you're both out of your frakkin' minds.
you know, you had a feeling you could find earth.
i trusted you.
i backed you every step of the way.
now i need you to trust ours.
ensign anders.
specialist tyrol.
slowly put your hands on your heads and face the viper.
do it now!
what the hell is going on?
they're cylons, just like the xo.
sam.
go ahead.
it's true, kara.
there's something different about this viper.
something's changed.
you gotta find it.
shut up.
fall back!
fall back!
where the hell are you taking us?
keep moving.
otherwise, we shoot you here.
no! this is a wild guess: you told them?
we should've done it day one.
get the baseship on the horn.
mr.
hoshi, we need the baseship.
what's going on?
d'anna's about to start executing more hostages.
okay, take me to d'anna.
no, she won't listen to you.
i was the one with her in the temple when she had the vision of the fivetake me.
he's right.
take him, it's good.
are you ready to come to your senses, mr.
president?
galen tyrol and samuel anders have just joined saul tigh in the airlock.
they found them.
they're in line for an express ride into a vacuum.
you want them alive, stand down.
i know lee.
press him and he'll back down.
target our nuclear weapons on the civilian fleet.
we'll see if he wants to play hardball.
d'anna.
gaius.
coercion won't work with lee adama.
he's too similar to his father.
lee's bluffing.
he's doesn't give a tinker's damn about those three, not now.
you push him, he'll kill them.
then the entire human race will die with them.
mr.
president, the baseship nukes just went hot. if any of our fleet starts spooling up-- they won't have time to jump before the cylons fire.
sergeant harder, clear the tube of everyone but tigh.
corporal.
do you really think that god brought you back from the darkness for this, d'anna?
maybe he brought you back for a different purpose.
to end this peacefully.
they will never forgive us for what we did to the twelve colonies, never.
proceed.
brute force did not work for you on new caprica.
it didn't work for you on the algae planet.
so why is it gonna work for you now? give me the key.
we have weapons lock on their ships.
what are you waiting for, apollo?
do it.
lee, stop!
stop, stop!
those three frakkin' cylons just gave us earth.
well, it's a colonial emergency locator signal.
and no other wireless in the fleet is picking this up?
gaeta's confirmed it.
the channel's empty except for this viper.
it's gotta be a signal from earth.
you're reaching, kara.
come on, lee, add it up.
i vanish into a storm.
ride this viper to earth.
coming back, i get a vision that leads me to the baseship.
its hybrid tells me that the final five cylons have been to earth, but we need the missing three, d'anna, to bring them out into the open.
and now we're starting to get messages from the beyond.
you heard the signal.
the final cylons led me to it.
if it's earth, they've given us the home of the thirteenth tribe just the way the hybrid said it would happen.
like it or not, lee, something's orchestrating this for a purpose.
a higher power.
call it whatever you want, but it seems to want us to find earth with the cylons.
one tiny needle in the whole fleet.
well, you're right.
it's wafer thin.
it's the best i could do at short notice.
so you're all in agreement this is the way to earth?
it's a stretch, but it's the best explanation we've got.
which is why we chose to share this information with you.
we could've jumped away with it, left you behind.
but that would've led to another confrontation, another standoff.
all this has happened before but it doesn't have to happen again.
not if we make up our minds to change.
take a different path.
right here, right now.
you were afraid we'd kill these four, and yet, here they are, standing right behind you.
free to go. or stay.
i've granted them an amnesty.
so the question is: where do we go from here?
all right.
i'll release your crew.
we go to earth together.
we've projected a course toward the signal.
it'll probably take some revising as we go, but this is our destination right here.
earth.
so, what are your orders, admiral?
orders?
are you ready to take us to our new home?
i don't know.
you don't know what?
what don't you know about?
it's good to see you.
bill, this is it.
this is it.
this is everything that we have been working for.
i want to see you pick up that first fistful of earth.
come on.
frak.
i see.
yeah.
thank you. thank you. anyway, i'm glad to see you again, madame president.
and so is the quorum.
and i guess i just finished the shortest presidency in colonial history.
yes, well, don't look so relieved, mr.
adama.
because you were dealt a crisis and you knew exactly what to do.
you faced it boldly.
this fleet is going to need that kind of leadership in the days to come, so you are not off the hook yet.
thank you. you guys just gonna sit here flap your lips or are we gonna go find earth?
kara and i have been working on a recon plan-- frak it.
this is the end of the line.
we've got nowhere else to go. and if we give the alliance too much time, it'll fall apart again.
gotta roll the hard six.
we all go together and as fast as we can.
yes, sir.
fleet in jump formation.
standing by.
board is green.
ship reports ready to jump, admiral.
very well.
madame president, without you we wouldn't have made it.
give the order.
it's been a long time coming.
okay.
take us to earth. in five, four, three, two, one, jump! jump complete.
dradis is clear.
fleet is checking in.
nav.
confirming position.
take your time.
get it right.
fleet all present and accounted for.
visible constellations are a match.
crew of galactica, people of the fleet.
this is admiral adama.
three years ago, i promised to lead you to a new home.
we've endured a difficult journey.
we've all lost, we've all suffered, and the truth is i questioned whether this day would ever come.
but today, our journey is at an end.
we have arrived at earth.
we made it, kid.
we did it.
you did it.
earth.
com/bbs=- com/bbs=-.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
no.
helo: what the hell is going on?
you killed her.
we gotta go.
right now.
billy: that's tom zarek.
dualla: the terrorist?
billy: he's a prisoner of conscience.
dualla: he's a butcher. he blew up a government building, there is no excuse for that.
i thought you said you respected me.
that was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking.
zarek: i demand the immediate resignation of laura roslin and her ministers.
i demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership.
if you let the rest of these hostages go, we will leave this ship in your hands.
mcmanus: got it?
man: test.
there.
mcmanus: are we on?
man: frack, we're on.
go.
mcmanus: live from cloud nine, the most luxurious ship in the fleet it's the colonial gang.
it's a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleet.
i'm james mcmanus, formerly of the caprica times.
with me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left.
playa palacios, veteran commentator for the picon star tribune.
welcome.
and my wingman, sekou hamilton, former editor of the aerilon gazette.
mcmanus:  as most people know cloud nine was damaged during a cylon attack and had to be evacuated.
with repairs now complete, president roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering.
it's the first meeting of the interim quorum of 12 which will coincide with colonial day the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the articles of colonisation.
playa, why don't you weigh in? laura roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances.
mcmanus: every delegate chosen so far has been a roslin crony.
it's a puppet quorum, okay? that will rubber-stamp every edict this power-mad schoolteacher will try how can you say that when half the quorum hasn't even been selected?
mcmanus: i predict every one of them will be a roslin lackey hand-picked by the power behind the throne, presidential advisor, wallace gray.
don't you see, gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt.
come on, jim.
wallace gray is no prince of darkness.
i disagree.
he's helped roslin regulate the internal economy made sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed he's a gasbag who's made a fortune through deals quorum members have profited from.
roslin: freedom of the press.
mcmanus: as we speak madam president, the fatuous gasbag would like minutes of your time.
wally.
roslin: how does it feel to be a celebrity?
gray: well, i love it.
they'll probably be calling me a fascist next.
no, i'm the fascist.
you stick with being the gasbag.
madam president, excuse me, you're going to want to hear this.
mcmanus: sagittaron have chosen their delegate for the interim quorum of 12. who would've guessed it?
tom zarek.
oh, my gods.
he's got quite a following out there.
i should have seen this coming.
he's a terrorist.
who are they kidding?
mcmanus: a ruthless terrorist.
hamilton: tom zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnap, attempted rape. he blew up a government building and now he's gonna sit on the quorum of 12? mcmanus: wrong.
the government trumped up charges to discredit a man who's dedicated his life for the disenfranchised.
yes? just a moment.
commander adama.
why am i not surprised?
roslin: hello, commander.
adama: are you listening to this? indeed.
can't allow a terrorist to sit in government.
roslin: my hands are tied.
i don't want to turn him into a martyr.
sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he's served his time.
tom zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet.
i can bar him from travelling to cloud nine on that basis alone.
i perfectly understand the threat tom zarek represents.
but the last thing i need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad.
we need to let this play out.
thank you. mcmanus:  hold onto your shorts.
there's another story.
we're getting a live feed from the astral queen.
tom zarek is about to make a statement.
zarek: citizens of the 12 colonies, i am humbled and moved by this great honour.
i will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful that turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor.
but roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us.
zarek:  people of the fleet, look up. the winds of change are blowing.
a new era is about to dawn.
hey, doc.
lt.
thrace, to what do i owe this honour?
our shuttle leaves for cloud nine at 05:12 tomorrow, so don't be late.
our shuttle?
a surprise getaway?
just the two of you? i'm going to be handling your security.
please don't touch that.
thank you. baltar: security for what?
starbuck: you haven't heard?
it's all over talk wireless.
when would i have the chance to listen to talk wireless?
i have 60 years of work in front of me.
anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse for lowbrow rabble-rousing.
you've been selected as caprica's delegate to the quorum of 12. me? is this some kind of joke?
guess you got the super-genius vote.
no accounting for taste.
starbuck: congratulations, doctor.
baltar: thank you. politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples.
all those interminable speeches.
all that dreary pomp.
parties full of young women drawn to men of power.
but when the people call, you must serve.
apollo: i can't remember the last time i felt the sunlight on my face.
sure feels good.
almost like the real thing.
starbuck: they could've done a better job with the horizon, though.
security's going to be a bitch.
a thousand different places for a sniper to hide.
how many people are we dealing with?
apollo: five hundred plus.
apollo: each colony's sending a delegation of leading citizens.
great.
herds of lookie-loos, any one of whom could be a cylon.
apollo: toasters aren't our only problem.
don't you pay any attention to politics?
no. a lot of unrest out there.
so why is roslin insisting on letting so many people come?
i guess she thinks it's important to them to be able to observe how their government works.
so basically, she's already running for re-election.
apollo: no, kara.
apollo: kara, give me that.
security agent: thank you, sir.
enjoy your day.
palacios: the atmosphere is electric as quorum members arrive with their delegations.
i'm outside the cloud nine ballroom where the reception of the new quorum of 12 will take place.
the question is, will president roslin shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist or will she snub him, and by extension, all the people of sagittaron?
col.
tigh.
my wife ellen.
welcome aboard.
kill me now.
col.
tigh.
apollo: starbuck, apollo.
zarek's here.
starbuck: copy.
starbuck: don't worry.
this guy's mine the second he makes a wrong move.
apollo:  yeah?
well, you'll have to beat me to him.
murderer.
you don't belong here, zarek.
go back.
grimes: what did you say? he's not a murderer, he's a freedom fighter.
grimes: all right?
apollo: excuse me.
may i see your security pass, sir? not a problem.
i'm a citizen of sagittaron.
i've got every legal right to be here.
your rights don't extend to roughing people up.
lay a hand on anyone else and you'll be getting to know galactica's brig.
apollo: well, everything's in order.
enjoy your stay on cloud nine.
oh, i will.
zarek: tom zarek.
tigh: col.
tigh, battlestar galactica.
i see.
my wife.
does she have a name?
ellen.
zarek: call me tom.
i don't like to stand on ceremony.
i'm the same way.
all this pretension makes me sick.
you're holding up the line.
thank you for making me feel welcome, ellen.
i hope to see you again.
why did you do that?
to get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet.
i don't need my picture taken with a terrorist.
wake up, saul.
look at these cameras.
roslin's the past, zarek's the future.
a blind man can see that.
zarek: madam president.
roslin: mr.
zarek.
if i were to offer you my hand in friendship would you take it?
well, there's only one way to find out.
zarek: that was nicely played.
roslin: thank you. just remember, i'm not your enemy, madam president.
roslin: and i know today's agenda is rather large but i think that if you'll look at the scheduled meetings you'll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet.
in some cases, existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies no.
6: you're missing an intriguing opportunity.
playa's not wearing any underwear.
don't be absurd.
really?
she's been eyeing you all afternoon.
she's certainly human.
you're not jealous?
no.
6: love isn't about sex, gaius.
that's an enlightened point of view.
i've been thinking as far as i'm concerned you can have any woman you want.
but always remember i have your heart.
yes. of course you do.
i can always rip it out of your chest if i need to.
roslin: so if there are no objections the chair will entertain motions to accept today's agenda as proposed.
i have an objection.
the chair recognises sagittaron.
all the items on your agenda are important, i agree.
ration distribution, education, medical services, all very important.
but i'm frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found.
really?
well, perhaps mr.
zarek could enlighten us? the election of a vice-president.
lf, gods forbid, anything should happen to you, madam president we have no designated successor.
the civilian branch of our government would be paralysed leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship.
sagittaron moves that the first item on the quorum's agenda should be nominations for vice-president.
second.
second.
second.
caprica seconds for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now.
but certainly, i think we can all agree that it'd be a good idea to have a successor.
the motion has been moved and seconded.
all those in favour of opening nominations for the vice-presidency, say aye.
all: aye.
aye.
roslin: the ayes have it.
the floor is now open for nominations.
the chair recognises virgon.
now, there is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet.
when i asked for his help he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and, hell, they were finished and gone while i was still waiting for the president's office to return my call.
i nominate tom zarek.
thanks.
is there a second?
gemenon seconds the nomination.
the nomination of tom zarek for the vice-presidency has been accepted.
the chair will remain open for 72 hours for nominations.
the session is now adjourned.
roslin: thomas zarek is not going to be my vice-president.
six months until the presidential election.
we could've handpicked a candidate.
it didn't shock me when bagot nominated him.
but porter, that was surprising.
not really.
the gemenon ships use more water per capita than any other ship.
she wanted more rations, i said no. zarek may have made some friends in the last few weeks but there are still plenty who hate him.
don't underestimate zarek.
he's charismatic and knows what buttons to push.
frankly, madam president, i am concerned about the security aboard cloud nine.
roslin: i want you leaning forward on this, captain.
roslin: if they even sneeze, they better have a handkerchief.
understood.
we need a candidate.
someone who will quickly win the delegates' support.
an established name.
i'm not a politician.
roslin: but you know how to get things done.
you've kept this fleet functioning all this time.
no.
thanks, but i can't allow tom zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, wally.
roslin: i need you.
you've got me, madam president.
how can you reassure people that you're looking out for their interests as opposed to the rehabilitation of tom zarek?
that's a great question, playa.
this is how i see it.
we're facing a situation so unique, so specific that i believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking.
like blowing up a building or two?
zarek: if things weren't so serious, i'd say that was funny.
look, there's no economy.
there's no market.
no industry.
no capital.
money is worthless.
and yet, we're all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be.
zarek: look where we are.
zarek: this man wakes up every morning tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden.
zarek:  why? because it's his job?
what job? he labours, but he gets no benefit from his labour.
he's not the only one.
many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives.
the lawyers still act like lawyers, but they have no clients.
businessmen still act like businessmen, but have no business.
president roslin and her policies are all about holding on to a fantasy.
if we want to survive, we need to completely restructure our lives.
we need to think about the community of citizens.
the group, not the individual.
we need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective.
you're not interested in the citizens.
you just want power.
turn that crap off.
i was listening to that broadcast.
apollo: you again?
that's a shame.
they want to hear mr.
zarek speak, too.
don't you, buddy?
see? he wants to hear mr.
zarek.
how about you? you want to hear what mr.
zarek has to say? i don't mind one way or the other.
well, i take that as a yes.
so turn it on.
now.
leave it.
mr.
zarek is a representative of the people and we are the people.
well, you're people.
sort of.
grimes: you know, i don't like your tone, flyboy so why don't you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather?
i'd be happy to, after you leave.
which is now.
grimes: okay.
don't want no trouble.
starbuck: what the hell.
starbuck: there's a gun.
starbuck.
starbuck: incoming.
apollo: are you looking for this?   the telamon building's still standing.
that's delphi, all right.
now, all we have to do is wait until dark infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet hope the cylons haven't completely wasted the spaceport steal a ship, locate galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell. is that all?
yeah.
i guess we can relax until dark.
might as well make ourselves comfortable.
boomer: you hungry?
helo: no, not right now.
helo: your stomach's feeling better?
boomer: starving.
i'm trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the cylons.
and? i can't fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters.
and they just happened to be twins?
that's too weird.
you got a better explanation?
you think the cylons could be messing with human dna? helo: cloning people or something?
boomer: could be.
that would explain how they took us by surprise.
they had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies laying the groundwork for the surprise attack.
you know, if they were human clones that means they're capable of complex emotions, maybe even love.
maybe they were misguided in the way that they were indoctrinated.
whatever they are, they're not human.
no human could do the things they've done.
killed billions of innocent people.
they've got to be fracking cylons, just like the rest of them.
why do you have a summit itinerary?
why circle every public appearance by president roslin?
it's not mine.
some stranger wandered down the hall, picked the lock to your room and left this?
false-bottom with anechoic coating to absorb x-rays.
ceramic stealth gun.
you sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard.
i carry a lot of money.
i need protection.
apollo: right.
the money's worthless.
your friend zarek pointed that out.
i don't even know zarek.
your pal grimes says different. he gave you up.
you're bluffing.
you haven't got anything.
we don't need anything, valance.
because this isn't a trial.
this is just you and us in this room.
starbuck: like zarek pointed out, we're living in a whole new world.
no due process.
this is your courtroom.
and that would make us your executioners.
starbuck: so you might want to cooperate, or else you're going out an air lock.
because that's what we do to traitors.
valance: look, i i just came over here for the booze and the food.
that's it.
you know what?
frack you! apollo: we put all the heat on valance we could but can't tie him to zarek.
i know zarek's behind this.
keep working on valance.
we will.
to be safe, i think you should send the sagittaron delegation back.
can't.
violates their civil rights, plays right into zarek's hands.
he could have another shooter on cloud nine and if zarek wins the vote, he's more than capable of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency.
zarek's not going to win because i'm not going to let him.
meanwhile, keep zarek under surveillance, tap his phones, bug his room.
if you find anything that remotely connects zarek to valance, shut him down.
the domestic policies we've been talking about over the last little while such as employment, housing and education latest vote count: seven for gray, five for zarek.
we're slip.
he was four an hour ago.
zarek must be making promises.
picon flipped.
roslin:  we've got to hold the colonies till they vote tomorrow.
gray: on page 33 of my mission statement i lay out a 16-point educational programme that the president and i have developed.
individuals with four-year college degrees will be eligible.
hi.
how are you doing?
remember me? we got valance.
and you're next.
gray: health care, it's one thing to talk zarek: can i get you something?
ellen: so you work here now? why should i ask the bartender to get me a drink?
what's in it for him?
a big tip.
what would he spend on?
so, are you worried about wallace gray?
i hear he's ahead in the vote count.
whatever the people want is fine by me.
everyone has an agenda.
i know i do.
zarek: and what would that be? the same as yours, tom.
me.
myself.
and i.  you are clearly a well-connected, well-informed woman.
ellen: wife of the xo.
for whatever that's worth.
quite a bit.
now and in the future.
that's what i'm interested in, tom.
my place and my husband's place in the future.
okay.
i'm looking for a friend of mine.
his name is valance.
how the hell did this happen?
we've got to get to the president.
mcmanus:  we're here with dr.
gaius baltar, representative of caprica.
dr.
baltar, i had one question.
is president roslin's political career terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it?
baltar: laura roslin's political career is very much alive and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake.
you miss the limelight, don't you, gaius?
yes, i have.
you have what, dr.
baltar?
nothing.
you were saying?
you seriously believe that this school teacher is able to handle the job of presidency?
his wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room.
so was it suicide or was it murder?
it was no suicide.
zarek had him killed.
lf only we could prove that.
how'd they get past the marine s?
apollo: through the vent.
baltar:  i'm glad to hear it because all of us have had teachers who made an impact on our lives.
history is full of examples of leaders who have come from the most humble beginnings and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events.
apollo: how many people knew where valance was being held?
starbuck: just the people in this room plus two marines.
baltar: criticise roslin and the tough decisions she has to make every day.
especially, if you're someone like tom zarek who's never shouldered any real responsibility in your life.
to be fair to tom, he's been in prison for the last 20 years.
and now that he's had a drastic personality makeover he's posing like he's the saviour to all your ills.
i think you all have a short memory.
well, someone talked.
and now we have no assassin, no evidence of a plot no check on zarek, no nothing.
if he can get to valance, he can get to anyone.
madam president, he will definitely try and take a shot at you now.
only if he wins the vote.
what i have to say is, we must survive.
and we will survive.
and we will do so through the values that have made our colonies great.
courage.
truth.
justice.
liberty.
with a firm and deep resolve to make tomorrow better.
not just for ourselves, but for our children.
madam president, i still worry the vote may be trending against you.
roslin: yes, it is.
but i'm going to win this thing.
and tom zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs.
roslin: but first i have two very unpleasant duties to perform.
i need a shuttle to cloud nine.
what am i supposed to say? health reasons.
oh, right, fine.
health reasons.
you know, all those years i watched you working with adar.
you were always so quiet, so polite so dignified.
i never thought you'd fit in with the bare-knuckled, backstabbing politicians.
i guess i was wrong.
all clear.
dr.
baltar?
are you in here?
baltar: madam president?
i heard you on the wireless.
you were very articulate, quite engaging.
oh, thank you. that's very encouraging.
yeah, i was just trying to do my bit as the elected representative of caprica.
besides, i'm beginning to get a real feel for politics.
so i take it you're not voting for mr.
zarek? a man who uses his intelligence and resources to blow up buildings doesn't get my vote, no.
no, i'm voting for your man gray.
he's really great. he is great, which is why he's got my vote.
roslin: unfortunately mr.
gray dropped out of the race.
then who do you want me to vote for?
i was thinking you.
me? look doctor, let's cut to the chase.
roslin: you're a very popular man these days.
roslin: i would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side.
under those circumstances, i accept.
baltar: thank you, madam president.
roslin: thank you. wow.
what are you going to do now?
now i'm going to give you an exclusive.
baltar: after you.
so what are we supposed to do? sit on our hands and watch her get killed?
zarek's too smart to take another shot at the president during the summit.
if he wins the vote, he can take her out later when everyone's forgotten about valance.
he'll just bide his time to find a better opportunity.
that's great.
anyway, she says she's not going to lose the vote.
she says a lot of things.
don't you think you should wash that?
starbuck: i did.
apollo: like when, a month ago?
do you have a problem with my hygiene?
you have hygiene?
i clean up good sometimes, all right?
well, let me know when it's one of those times.
tauron, gaius baltar.
the surprises just keep on coming.
a number of the quorum delegates have now shifted their support to the scientific genius a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasions.
at this point, jim, it is anyone's guess as to who's going to win, but my money is on gaius.
dr.
baltar.
aquaria, thomas zarek.
aerilon: tom zarek.
palacios: the vote is now six-five in favour of tom zarek.
the next vote will determine our new vice-president.
if zarek gets it, he wins.
in the event of a tie, the president will cast the deciding vote.
citizens i give you your new vice-president, dr.
gaius baltar.
the perks of power, mr.
vice-president.
we're going to do great things together.
good.
it's difficult to fathom.
i never aspired to power. of course you didn't, gaius.
but someone had to step up.
well, after what laura told me laura?
baltar: yeah, we're on a first name basis now.
now look, i think the people need me.
excuse us.
so that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good.
and the other one's not too bad either.
lee, if you want to ask me to dance, just ask.
you want to dance?
me in a dress is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
madam president.
mr.
zarek.
oh, don't worry, i won't be kissing you today.
that's a shame.
i shaved very closely in anticipation of being smacked by you.
that was very nicely played.
again.
but there's still a presidential election in six months.
i'll see you then.
i have no doubt.
oh, one thing you should know.
i didn't kill valance.
i wonder who did?  madam president, good evening.
i thought you hated these things.
it's colonial day.
where else would i be? i'm a patriot.
you really are, aren't you?
adama: dr.
baltar.
interesting choice.
i figured, the devil you know.
politics.
as exciting as war.
adama: definitely as dangerous.
though in war you only get killed once. in politics, it can happen over and over.
you're still standing.
so are you.
and i can dance.
i have a surprise for you.
should i be worried?
not unless you consider a day in a luxury suite aboard the rising star as something to be worried about.
what?
how did you swing that?
i have my ways.
what you need to do is figure out a way to get slave-driving bill to give you the day off.
tigh:  yeah.
and while we're there, we might want to talk to a few people about your future.
what?
later, my love. it can all wait until later.
any second now.
if we get caught if anything happens you don't have to say anything.
i know.
we're going to make it, sharon.
okay?
okay.
go.
sharon?
we're still alive.
why nobody else? you never get tired.
trust me.
helo, come with me.
helo.
helo.
.
previously on battlestar galactica this is the battlestar pegasus to the ship claiming to be the galactica, please respond.
pegasus how could that be the entire fleet was destroyed.
admiral cain.
on behalf of the officers and the crew of the pegasus, welcome back to the colonial fleet.
the cylon fleet is composed of base ships, about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
it's this large ship here that i'm interested in.
i'm going to integrate the crews.
i thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
i'm laird, pegasus deck chief.
you're an aeronautical engineer - yeah, i was.
so you're really a civilian i was on the scylla, and we got picked up by the pegasus.
things happened.
how much time do i have weeks, a month at the outside.
will i be able to work unless the cancer goes to your brain.
that happens, you we have our own cylon prisoner.
she's obviously been abused, tortured.
will you help her, gaius you really want to get close you got to use the stealth ship we constructed aboard galactica.
carbon composit.
it's going to be hard as hell to see on dradis.
starbuck, you're off this mission.
a surveillance package go get the blackbird.
take some pretty pictures of our cylon ship.
who the hell's this thorne - lieutenant thorne, sir.
your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
get off her don't either of you fracking move don't move they've been found guilty on all counts.
she's gonna execute them both for murder and treason.
galactica is launching vipers and a raptor.
why are you launching vipers i'm getting my men.
launch the alert vipers.
galactica, kat.
i got inbound pegasus vipers coming right at me. request instructions.
you've gotta let them defend themselves.
we should turn our main batteries on pegasus.
galactica, kat.
request weapons free.
we need your help.
kat, galactica.
do not fire unless fired upon.
i repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
galactica, kat they're really fracking with us out here.
galactica, hot dog.
one of them just pulled into my kill slot.
got them in range, locking on.
galactica, standing hot dog, watch your six, he's right behind you.
evasive action, come on fracking frackers okay, you're gonna have to break your course now.
narcho, pegasus.
do not fire first.
stinger, pegasus.
you are ordered to relieve captain adama of duty and aid in the attack mission on galactica.
your weapon, captain.
you're relieved.
permission to go aft.
granted.
he's right on top of me.
viper 1, viper 1. close, you're too close.
come on, break.
frack me they're all over us galactica, request weapons free.
they're coming around for another pass.
repeat, request weapons free.
come on, starbuck.
tell me you're out there somewhere.
what the hell is that starbuck here.
what the hell is going on dradis contact single bogey and it's nearly on top of us.
identify no transponders, no recognition codes, it has to be a cylon raider, sir.
admiral, sir, this has gotta be a raider.
well, how the frack did it get in so close without being detected i don't know, sir, i assume it came out of nowhere.
right.
recall the vipers.
bring the ship about.
and prepare to engage the enemy.
all pegasus vipers, all pegasus vipers, emergency recall.
there's a cylon raider right on top of you.
attention all galactica vipers, you've got a cylon raider comin'right at you.
there you are, you bastard.
on my lead quick right, full power, x-axis climb starbuck to all vipers, do not fire repeat, do not fire i am a friendly, okay we're all friendlies.
so, let's just be friendly.
that's no raider, that's that stealth ship of yours.
who's flying it it wasn't cleared to launch.
you got me, i'm just a passenger back here.
galactica, kat.
it's the blackbird, galactica.
repeat, it's the blackbird.
what the hell is the blackbird doing out there it's starbuck.
she launched in the blackbird a couple hours ago. said she was running flight tests for admiral cain.
that doesn't sound likely.
another one of her crazy ass stunts.
thank the gods.
you can say that again.
get me pegasus.
this is pegasus actual, go ahead.
you can either stand down or we can start shooting at each other.
it's your call.
admiral.
wait one.
we're receiving a download, admiral.
that is the cylon fleet.
are these from our recon mission no, sir. the recon mission was aborted.
these are from blackbird.
thrace she took off and did the whole recon mission alone.
my gods, look at these shots, jack.
she put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it.
admiral, i still have commander adama on the line and our fighters are stil requesting instructions.
should they resume the attack all right, joint recall.
both ships stand down to condition two.
then i want you to report to me directly, in person.
i have no intention of coolling my heels in your brig.
fine.
neutral ground, colonial one.
no aides.
be there in 15 minutes.
stand down, condition two.
there you are.
season - episode 11 resurrection ship let's start this by admitting an ugly truth.
what happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room.
we are the leaders of this fleet.
as such, we need to set an example.
we cannot continue to let the conflicts between us-- oh, let's just cut through the handholding, shall we two of his men murdered on of my officers, while protecting a cylon.
they're guilty, they admitted it.
and under regulations, i have complete authority to try, convict, and sentence them.
and you and i both know that the penalty for that crime is death.
admiral, surely the spirit of the law requires something more here than summary executions. is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months debating the finer points of colonial law well, guess what, we're at war and we don't have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
you wanna cut through it, fine.
you have pegasus, he has galactica.
two heavily armed, very powerful warships.
now, i am sure that pegasus would prevail in any fight.
i wouldn't count on that.
but certainly, there'd be heavy damage and you'd take significant casualties.
so you can go out there and fight it out with galactica or you can compromise.
and those are the only two options on the table, period.
how the two of you have survived this long, i will never know.
all right.
lieutenant thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the cylon fleet.
i want that fleet.
and i need galactica to get it.
so i'm willing to go this far.
i'll suspend the execution until after the attack.
and i want them back on galactica.
i don't give a damn what you want.
you're frakking lucky you're not staring at your own warrant.
the destruction of the cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations.
after that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue.
thank you. stand at ease, lieutenant and come forward.
seems you've had quite a day.
i'm promoting you to captain.
i'm making you commander of the pegasus air group.
you're promoting me i need a cag with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet.
now, i thought stinger was that man.
but he managed to let captain adama contact you and pull off that fly-by right under his nose, so, he's out.
and captain adama, sir truth be told, i came this close to throwing him in the brig.
but i couldn't exactly charge him and not you, so i just revoked his flight status.
i want him on my team, sir.
and do you always get what you want most of the time sir.
good.
me too.
all right, you can have him.
i hear you want to return to caprica.
yes, sir.
we have people back there still alive.
yes, and they deserve to be saved.
i absolutely agree. in fact, i will go one step further and i will say that our ultimate goal is that we should return to the 12 colonies and kick the cylons the frack out of our homes.
what do you think of that, captain i think that's the best idea i've heard all day, sir.
i'm afraid this can only end one way.
we've got to kill her.
what the hell are you talking about like she said, let's cut through it.
the two of you were willing to go to war today.
do you think she's going to step down from that she's going to bide her time and hit you the first chance she gets.
that's a given.
i hate to lay this on you bill, but she is dangerous and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you.
i'm not an assassin.
no.
you're not an assassin, you are a colonial officer who's taken an oath to protect this fleet.
what do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet once she has eliminated you you know i'm right.
you just don't want to face it.
so the whole world's going mad your fluid and electrolytes levels are stable.
but i think the baby's going to be fine.
you do have a cracked rib though.
hairline fracture, which means it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.
but i'm not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack.
the attack.
is that what we're calling it now they were not from the galactica.
they were from the pegasus.
so what what about helo and the chief i heard a rumor they're going to be executed.
i'm not going to let that happen.
well, how are you going to do that isn't admiral cain in command - what happened to you was unforgivable.
happened aboard my ship, on my watch.
and it's my responsibility.
so i just want you to know that i personally apologize.
see that she's okay, then back into her cell.
aren't we supposed to be dead everyone said execution in an hour, it's been at least two.
ah, i'm not complaining.
id confirmed so.
just how many different kinds of stupid are you more than we can count.
what's going on, captain.
good news, you're not dead yet.
bad news, it's a delay, not a pardon.
there's a big op coming up and the  squad's on hold till it's over.
yeah, the old man went to mat for you guys on this one, and then some.
we were this close to a shooting war with the pegasus.
frack me.
what the hell's going on thought the cylons were the enemy.
yeah, now it's us.
what's wrong, gaius nothing.
nothing.
i suppose i just, uh lost interest.
in me - no, not in you, in in this. in this place.
i suppose i just don't really miss it anymore.
you know what i miss sports.
you're joking.
no.
i used to go the pyramid court just before game time.
scalp two tickets.
if i timed it right, i'd just be sitting down at the horn.
sit back let the energy of the crowd flow over me.
waves and waves of emotion.
like an electric current.
why did you get two tickets one for me, and one for you.
i know i'd never get you to go.
pyramid was far too lowbrow for you, but i always liked to feel that you were there with me.
id confirmed well, i see that you got it to eat.
that's progress, i suppose.
can you get it to roll over beg see what it can make of these.
you know this thing used to sit in our mess and eat our food, and listen to our stories.
didn't you you just sat there listening to us, pretending to be our friend, didn't you admiral, please any physical contact with the subject will only to set my efforts back at this point.
find out about that ship.
i want to die.
will you help me do that will you kill me, please hey, i'm just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here.
but i'm reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing, sure.
i mean, um, yes, sir.
thank you, chief.
cally.
laird's not military, is he no, sir. he was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called the scylla civilian do you know how he got on the pegasus scuttlebutt is that the pegasus used to have a civilian fleet but something happened to them.
thank you. laird's ship was the scylla.
scylla was, uh civilian transport.
we found her and a few other civvies about a week after the attack.
they were good ships.
ftl drives and weapons even.
a lot of potential spare parts that we could use on pegasus.
so the admiral made a decision.
military needs are a priority.
you stripped them.
you stripped the ships for parts sweet mother of artemis.
how much equipment did you take you take their jump drives - left all those people marooned out there - no, not all.
admiral cain looked over the passenger list and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasn't.
scylla was the toughest.
laird and 15 other men and women, they were all all traveling with their families.
wives, husbands, children. the selectees they refused to go.
there was resistance.
so the order came down to shoot the family of anyone who refused to come.
so we did.
two families, we put them up against the bulkhead.
and we shot them.
a cag's work is never done.
hi how ya doing oh, you mean apart from being demoted finding myself working for one of my pilots great.
never better.
you know i had nothing to do with that, right never thought you did.
i just checked in on helo and tyrol.
they're hanging tight for now.
good.
help me plan this op.
i've been staring at this roster.
you wanna just carry on as if nothing's happened lee, she's in command, what do you want to do there's nothing we can do.
i thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
were you aware of your true nature as a cylon when you boarded the ship or would you describe you as a sleeper agent i knew what i was.
i was a soldier.
i had a mission, i carried it out.
i thought that when it was done i was going to die.
that you would kill me.
then i then i would download into a new body be reborn.
but you didn't kill me. the things you did to me.
what they did to you was wrong.
evil.
but i'm not one of them.
you have to believe me.
things are going to get better for you.
from this moment on.
i promise.
i don't want things to get better.
i want to die.
but you know you can't die.
you do know that, don't you your consciousnessill merely transfer and you'll wake up in another body.
not if you destroy that.
what, this this ship tell me.
what's so important about this ship the cylon's call this their resurrection ship.
at the moment, we are too far away from the cylon home world for the normal downloading process to work, which is why they built this ship.
it contains the entire apparatus necessary for cylon resurrection.
now this ship has been traveling with the fleet trailing galactica for the last several months so it's a safety net a place where they fall back to when they die.
and if they lose their safety net then any cylon who dies out here would be dead.
as in, really dead.
i daresay they won't like that.
no, sir.
they might even stop chasing us.
why risk getting killed if you can't just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand-new body doctor, i think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
i have good days and bad days, but don't look so worried i'm not dying today.
sorry.
what can i do for you you were right about cain pegasus had a civilian fleet with her, cain stripped them.
for parts, supplies people.
i wish i could say i was surprised, but it's who she is.
she's playing for keeps, you've gotta do the same.
what's gotten into you you've become so bloody-minded.
i know that as long as cain lives, your survival is at risk, i know that.
what can i get you a new body.
perhaps, one of those young cylon models from the resurrection ship.
i can't see you as a blonde.
you'd be surprised.
we'll see you tomorrow commander.
she won't hesitate to kill you.
don't let her.
you know, when we get outta here i'm gonna make some changes.
yeah like what me and sharon.
it's done.
i mean, really done, i can't do it anymore.
don't get me wrong.
lt., what we did, i would do again in a heartbeat.
but i've gotta let it go.
i so thought i had let go.
yeah i know what you mean.
you yeah, me.
what you think i don't have second thoughts sometimes you think i don't wonder i'm losing my frakkin'mind i'm in love a woman i know isn't a woman.
i'm having a baby that's that's what half machine you really do love her, don't you yeah.
yes, i do.
and i can't let go of it.
but if you can let it go.
our primary objective is a vessel named resurrection by the cylons.
it's ed by two basestars which have been following us throughout this sector.
our plan, simply put, is to let them find us.
we will wait in this system here and appear to be conducting mining operations.
when the cylons launch the raiders, galactica and most of the civilians will jump away.
a small group of civilians will be left behind.
to the cylons, they'll appear to be having trouble with their ftl drives and attempting to escape at sub-light speed.
the cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys pulling the raiders farther away from the cylon basestars as they can.
once the raiders have been drawn off by the decoys, galactica and pegasus will jump in and attack the basestars while i jump in, in the blackbird stealth fighter and take out the ftl drives on the resurrection ship, preventing it from jum away.
why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start we ran simulations on that.
we determined that the cylons would detect the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range.
when the ftl is destroyed galactica and pegasus will take on the basestars and our attack squadrons will go after the resurrection ship itself.
how many squadrons?
all of'em.
is there a problem?
i need time to study the operational details. suit yourself.
i've gone over the details and i'm satisfied.
i want your cag to stay and help me.
answer some of my questions.
one hour, thrace.
yes, sir.
stay focused, son jack, i want to transfer a detachment of marines to galactica.
and i want you to handpick them.
completely reliable.
completely loyal.
razors.
i have a mission for you, kara.
anything for you, you know that.
don't accept too quickly.
you won't like this one.
i don't like it.
but i've decided that it has to be done.
i'm transferring you to galactica, as well.
i'll tell adama that you're there to be my eyes and ears.
he'll hate it.
he'll think you're my spy and try to freeze you out of decision-making.
but he'll accept it.
now i want you to stay in cic throughout the attack.
stay with adama.
after the attack is completed and you've accounted for your pilots i want you to land your bird on the pegasus to report.
directly to cic.
you'll take lee with you.
he'll watch your back.
position marines in key areas throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside cic.
there'll the normal chaos emotional high after the attack.
they'll be slap each other on the back, celebrating the victory.
they'll keep their  down.
security will be lax.
i will ask for you over the wireless.
i will call you directly, and when i have you on the line and you hear me give the command 'execute case orange' when you hear me say 'downfall' you are to signal the marines to terminate adama's command.
starting with adama.
i want you to pull out your weapon and shoot admiral cain in the head.
previously on battlestar galactica i don't know what to make of you and me.
i'm having trouble accepting this.
we have to push forward.
keep the fleet together.
find earth.
pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of the human race.
and the lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland.
i came back with d'anna to be with my people.
because you're one of the five.
you're one of the final five.
turns out there's another kind of cylon we didn't know about, and i'm one of them.
corporal!
get it out of my sight!
put your hands on your heads and face the viper.
do it now!
what the hell is going on?
they're cylons.
there's something different about this viper.
something's changed.
you gotta find it.
that's a colonial emergency locator signal.
so you're all in agreement this is the way to earth?
it's a stretch, but it's the best explanation we've got.
so the question is, where do we go from here?
we go to earth together.
earth.
admiral.
our scouts say the same all over the planet.
no answers to our hails.
no signs of human life.
it's the same report we got from ours.
this signal's pretty weak.
the emergency locator battery must be running low on juice.
it was probably on for a long time.
low level radiation.
definitely in the water and the food chain.
put word out not to eat or drink anything down here.
baltar just confirmed it.
the planet was nuked about 2,000 years ago. it squares with what our teams have been finding all over the planet.
it's perfect.
we traded one nuked civilization for another.
let's get out of here.
just don't give up.
just don't give up.
don't fall apart.
just it's okay.
easy, dee.
take it easy.
get me out of here.
madame president! madame president, is earth really a wasteland?
is there anything? is there anything anything at all? the president will be making a statement in due course.
you will find out everything in good time.
in good time!
it's colonial.
it's standard on all aircraft.
part of our inertial nav system.
757-nc.
kara, what is it?
what does it mean? the number on my ship is 8757-nc.
i'm gonna get her! i'm gonna get her! hello.
i've got you!
no, stop!
i'm gonna go into the table!
raptor's down!
appreciate it, dee.
oh, you kidding?
i look forward to this.
i look forward to this.
we'll be back soon, okay?
thanks, dee.
bye, baby! bye.
you have no idea what's happened, do you?
today is just another day.
hey, over here!
what is it?
i don't know.
we found a couple of these scattered among the bones in sites around the planet.
centurions.
similar, but they're not one of ours.
we've never seen this design.
so the thirteenth tribe settled here and created their own cylons.
and then the machines rose up and killed their masters.
that's what we thought.
until we tested the bones.
from four different sites on the planet.
using our protocols the results are conclusive.
what's your point?
they're not human.
they're cylon.
all of 'em? all of them.
the thirteenth tribe was cylon.
the thirteenth tribe, the tribe of cylons, came to this planet and called it earth.
madame president, what do we do about the quorum?
you need to talk to them.
we need to tell them something.
it should come from their president.
carry the ball.
bill, we need to talk.
there's a lot of things i gotta explain.
fresh fruit, get your fresh fruit.
fresh fruit, four for one.
fresh fruit, all organic, four for one.
four for one.
fresh fruit, get your fresh your fruit.
fresh fruit, four for one.
fresh fruit, get four for one.
fresh fruit here!
can i ask for tiger lilies in those?
are these ripe?
get your fresh fruit here!
strawberries!
fresh pineapple!
if my viper's splattered all over this planet, then who flew it here?
and what the hell did i fly back to galactica?
maybe it's better off not knowing.
you're always telling me to face the truth and not run from it.
why the sudden change of heart?
i've got a feeling you might not like what you find.
for me or you?
there you are. the raptor's ready to take you back to colonial one.
what are you doing in here?
i was just thinking.
about all the pilots who sat in those seats.
gave their lives for a dream of a new beginning on earth.
i don't want their sacrifice to be meaningless.
you've got that look again.
what look? the one you had when your father took galactica back to new caprica.
we stayed behind on pegasus with the civilian fleet.
you thought you'd never see him again.
that easy to read, huh? just to me.
there were some good times for us, weren't there, on pegasus?
yeah.
i remember what you told me.
we had to keep the human race going.
and you did.
no, we did.
i couldn't have done it without you, dee.
you will this time, too.
i don't know how.
i don't know what the frak i'm gonna tell the quorum.
good news is real estate prices are low.
truth is, there is no happy way to spin this thing.
so don't.
tell them the truth.
that's what people need to hear, and you're the one they need to hear it from.
if anybody can give them a reason to go on it's you apollo.
would you, um i was gonna grab a drink around 19:00. would you join me? it's a date.
help me, godsdamn it!
if you've got an explanation for this, now's the time.
i don't have one.
i was wrong.
about earth.
your hybrid told me something. said that i was the harbinger of death.
that i would lead us all to our end.
she told you that? is it true? is it true?
if that's me lying there, then what am i? what am i? what am i? you remember something?
yeah.
i used to live here.
me too.
that song that switched us on?
i played it.
for a woman i loved.
i remember.
you do? you played it for all of us.
that was me.
we died in a holocaust.
then why are we still alive?
that happened 2,000 years ago.
how did we get to the colonies?
come to think that we were human?
we gotta do something.
morale is going down the toilet.
what are you doing? the pythian prophecy.
cottle told me that you didn't show up for your doloxan treatment.
that's right.
do you want to tell me why? i didn't feel like it.
you're gonna reschedule.
i don't think so.
laura, you need your treatments.
no, i don't.
what are you doing?
you just gonna lie down and quit?
you're the one who made me believe in this.
you shouldn't have listened to me.
when the cylons first attacked, you should've held your ground and kept fighting.
because i was wrong.
i was wrong about everything.
and all those people who listened, and they trusted me, and they followed me, all those people they're dead.
that's not don't, stop.
stop.
don't touch me.
just go.
burn.
burn.
tell me again.
oh, come on.
you've heard it three times, dee.
i want to remember every word.
all right, um, i said, ladies and gentlemen, we now have a choice.
we can either view this as a catastrophe or an opportunity.
an opportunity.
i, lee adama ex-acting president, former commander of the obliterated battlestar pegasus, apollo to my friends, i choose the latter.
yes! we're no longer enslaved by the ramblings of pythia. of pythia.
no longer pecking at the breadcrumbs of the thirteenth tribe. of the thirteenth tribe.
we are now free to go where we want to go  and be who we want to be.
i'm so proud.
i think i managed to stall a full scale panic, but i got no idea what to do next.
that is the best fun i have had in a long, long time.
thank you for that.
what?
you're glowing.
am i? all i can think of is that waste of a planet.
oh, felix, please.
i just want to hang on to this feeling for as long as i can.
okay.
look at that.
little anna's got her smile back.
sometimes i don't even remember that's me.
it's so long ago.
she has no frakkin' idea what's ahead of her.
yeah, none of us do.
oh, no.
no! no, no.
oh, my gods, help!
no, no, no, it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna okay.
we need we need a medic.
she's gonna be okay.
she's we need a medic here!
we need a medic!
oh, frak oh, gods.
medic!
she kissed me good night 45 minutes ago, and there was joy in her eyes.
so tell me why would she do this?
i don't frakkin' know.
no.
what did you do? i let you down.
i let everybody down.
give me your sidearm.
sir? frakkin' now! leave it loaded.
yes, sir.
i think we should have that little heart to heart you've been pining for.
sit down, cylon.
looks like you've got a head start on me, bill.
and it looks like you still don't know when to shut your frakkin' mouth and follow orders.
bill, i am so sorry that i didn't have the guts to tell you when i first found out.
frak you! you got no guts.
you're a frakkin' machine. is that how it worked?
they program you to be my friend?
emulate all the qualities i respect.
tell me jokes and i'd laugh at them.
bill i was your friend because i chose to be.
i wanted to be.
ah, ellen.
yeah, you know, ellen was smarter than i gave her credit for.
don't go there, bill.
smarter than me.
she knew from the beginning that there was something wrong with you.
what?
that's why she went around frakkin' half the colonial fleet.
shut your mouth!
searching out, trying to find a man who had real blood in his main vein.
shut your frakkin' mouth!
she came on to me once.
like a dog in heat.
i could smell.
i could smell it.
she smelled so good.
go on, do it.
do it, do it!
or i will.
go on, go on.
do it.
go on.
oh, my gods.
that's why you came here.
to do this.
you haven't got the frakkin' guts to do it yourself.
i'm sorry, bill.
this is one time i can't help you.
i think we've both had enough.
did i ever tell you about my summers with my uncle when i was a kid? foxes would attack his henhouse all the time.
really pissed him off.
he'd wake me up.
we'd go with his hounds at night up into the hills looking for the fox.
when the dogs smelled the scent, they'd go crazy.
the pack would become a team.
forced the fox toward the river.
so what would the foxes do? half would turn and fight.
the other half would try to swim across.
but my uncle told me about a few that they'd swim halfway out, turn with the current, and ride it all the way out to sea.
fishermen would find them a mile offshore just swimming.
because they wanted to drown.
maybe.
or maybe they were just tired.
well, godsdamn it, bill.
we can't swim out to sea.
i am the xo of this ship.
you are the commanding officer.
how is putting a bullet in your head gonna help dee? it is sure as frak isn't gonna help all the others who are thinking about doing the same godsdamn thing.
and what are they gonna do without the old man here to lead them?
heh lead them where, saul?
lee.
i hear you lost the signal.
you couldn't find the source.
yeah.
um, ahem, i need to talk.
i've gotta tell somebody.
you look like hell.
what's going on?
oh dee.
what about dee? she shot herself.
my gods.
yeah.
i don't i don't understand.
no, neither do i, you know.
i'm trying to come up with a neat answer.
but, um, truth is, i'll never know.
'cause it's too frakkin' late.
mr.
hoshi.
take over for lieutenant dualla.
yes, sir.
mr.
gaeta.
sir.
find me the closest g, f, or class star system.
mr.
hoshi, get the cylon baseship on the horn.
see if our new allies want to come along for the ride.
men and women of the fleet.
this is the admiral.
the discoveries of the past few days have been painful for all of us.
as you know, we cannot stay on earth.
but this is not a new challenge.
the thirteen tribes of kobol stood exactly on the same spot that we are right now.
they experienced dreadful losses.
their planet was a graveyard.
they needed a home.
so they set out in the void of deep space with nothing but their ships and their guts.
and the thirteen succeeded.
they weren't supermen.
they were ordinary people like us.
what they can accomplish, we can accomplish.
we will find a new home.
this is a promise i intend to keep.
all right, people, pack it up.
we're off this rock in 15 minutes.
you'd better get back to your ship. the fleet is about to jump.
i'm not going.
you know, all this is just gonna happen again and again and again.
so i'm getting off this merry-go-round.
i'm gonna die here with the bones of my ancestors, and it beats the hell out of being out there with cavil.
gonna die in the cold and the dark when cavil catches up with us.
well, i wouldn't count the old man out.
he'll find us a home.
don't you ever want to stop fighting it, colonel?
don't you just want to stop all of this? and just ride the tide out to sea.
saul! saul.
saul! saul! i'll get you out! saul it's okay.
it's okay.
everything's in place.
we'll be reborn again.
together.
ellen.
ellen, you're the fifth.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
starbuck: like my new toy?
it's my very own cylon raider.
boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around.
congratulations, doctor.
you've just uncovered your very first cylon.
she probably doesn't know.
if something happened to you i wouldn't know how to deal with it.
i feel the same way.
boomer: i'm a cylon.
helo, come with me.
helo.
helo, come with me! adama: new piece of equipment that just appeared in cic.
officer: he had this when we found him.
send it to galactica.
the lab can look at it.
it's a cylon device.
i'll continue to take the chamalla.
it has other benefits.
the hallucinations?
you're going to find kobol.
birthplace of us all. he says we're gonna find kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to earth.
you all right?
you all right?
helo: stop!
don't come any closer.
just do it.
starbuck: oh, lee! boomer: oh, god.
pa system: attention.
pass the word for lt.
valerii.
lt.
valerii, report to the ready room for a pre-flight briefing.
you don't lose control.
thanks.
no.
you got to lose control.
let your instincts take over.
i thought we were just sparring.
that's why you don't win.
roslin: the doctor said i have six months at the outside.
he said the cancer's moved into my lymphatic system.
aggressively moved in.
i want you to hear me on this.
you made a true believer out of me.
strange as that sounds, considering.
but i believe.
i know you're the one to lead us to our salvation.
you are going to guide us to earth.
then we better find it soon.
i'm out.
like it's yours.
i picked up your five.
frankly, i don't care.
no, thank you, doctor, i have a watch later.
apollo: crashdown hits.
davis?
crashdown: what?
crashdown: a little bit of this. a little bit of that.
apollo: you guys always play this slow?
crashdown: what did you say? crashdown: don't distract me.
apollo: uncanny, i know.
all right, 20, i call.
and i raise you another 30.
you can't compete with me.
i always win. i'm sorry.
no.
6: never seen you like this, gaius.
it's disappointing somehow.
common.
so sorry to disappoint you.
baltar: disappoint you all.
thirty.
and i call it.
gaeta: what do you got, buddy?
absolutely nothing.
not bad, crash.
but not compared to that.
dualla: oh! apollo: you are apollo: no! dualla: you win every time.
baltar: sorry, i have to do it.
baltar: very sorry to disappoint you.
starbuck: there's a card game gaeta: hey.
she's back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen.
how are you feeling?
hey, gaius.
starbuck: good.
baltar: mr.
vice president, if you don't mind, lt.
thrace.
some level of decorum must be maintained, or is it a pirate ship you're running?
no.
just a battlestar, sir.
gaeta: all right, let's play.
would you like to play?
maybe you'd like to sit next to capt.
adama?
sure, kara.
why don't you pull up a pew? no, that's okay, lee.
i've got things to do.
baltar: nothing's wild.
here we go.
roslin: all right, currency.
while bartering will continue for the foreseeable future we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency-based standard.
no.
6: do you love her? did you roslin: dr.
baltar if something should happen to me, it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures beginning to fall into place here.
do you understand this? answer me.
yes, of course i understand.
my answer is no.
no, i don't think i can handle this right now.
baltar: the intricacies of the bureaucracy, i can't get my head around.
this which, with all due respect, madam president you have spent your entire political career learning to understand.
more to the point how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by a new thing it just astounds me.
how did you seriously think i could cope with this kind of responsibility?
no.
6: i don't believe you.
you're a genius, are you not? baltar: well, quite frankly, i don't give a flying frack whether you believe me or not.
all right?
because i've had it.
i am tired of being pushed and prodded around like i'm some kind of toy.
i'm not your plaything.
plaything?
i don't work for you! and quite frankly, i don't have to sit here anymore and take this kind of abuse from either of you! you either!
either in here, either in there.
wherever it is, i don't need to take it.
i love you, gaius.
do me a favour.
no.
6: yeah?
i think perhaps you need a break from this.
you're right.
we need a break.
i'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
no.
6: how can you love her, gaius?
baltar: i don't.
you can't lie to me, i know everything you know.
that's lovely.
thank you. did you did you want something in particular this time?
i thought you should know that it's not safe to remain on galactica.
what are you talking about?
it's a surprise.
tell me, what is it?
what is it?
is it a bomb?
another cylon bomb, right? is it an agent? is a cylon agent about to be activated?
tell me! boomer: galactica, this is raptor preparing to jump to sector 728.
let's hope we find some supplies out there.
tigh: roger that.
good hunting out there.
crash, counter our spinner?
fuel drive's spun up and ready.
jump in five, four, three, two, one.
crashdown: whoa, baby!  frack me!  gaeta, the fracking idiot.
you can't plan a jump that close to a planet.
what if we jumped into it?
it was great.
it's fine.
we made it.
we're cool.
crashdown: are you seeing this? boomer: yeah.
crashdown: oceans.
continents.
no.
let me at this thing.
okay.
atmosphere reads as: nitrogen, oxygen.
looks like enough co2 for green leafy things.
i'm getting excited here, boomer.
boomer, this could be it.
this could be the big one.
this is the little planet that solves all our problems.
boomer?
do you think this is earth?
no.
it's not earth.
it's more important than that.
doesn't really work as well as before, huh? you know, i do get cold.
there's some things you should know, helo.
don't call me that.
you're not even sharon.
you're not even human.
so don't act like you know me because you don't! but i am sharon!
and that's part of what you need to understand! sharon was a friend of mine! whatever twisted thing you are, you are not sharon!
you got that? the only thing i want from you is a way off this fracked up world.
that's it!
apollo: going hunting? i'm adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow.
see if our boy can shoot anything with our ammo.
so it's a boy now? starbuck: i changed my mind.
apollo: you ever wonder why everyone calls it a she, but to you, it's a he? it's fascinating, lee.
you should write a paper.
it's not really my scene.
i'm not as smart as, say, dr.
baltar.
apollo: how is the vice president, by the way?
i don't know.
haven't seen him.
so he's a love them and leave them kind of guy, i guess.
i guess.
apollo: ships just pass in the night.
starbuck: yup.
apollo: didn't mean a thing.
starbuck: nope.
just bored.
looking for something to do.
so fracking the vice president seemed like a great way to waste some time.
you want something from me? not a thing.
i don't owe you anything.
you don't owe me anything.
because i'm just a cag, and you're just a pilot.
right.
a pilot that can't keep her  on!
right.
it's just like old times, kara.
like when you got drunk and couldn't keep your hands off the major from wherever starbuck: god! why did you do it, kara?
just tell me why.
because i'm a screw-up, lee.
try and keep that in mind.
billy: commander adama is sending out another raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet.
billy: it appears to have suffered some sort of calamity but it could actually be inhabitable.
billy: aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface.
billy: it was obviously abandoned long ago.
elosha: how old are the ruins?
we won't know for sure until we send a ground team but the initial estimates have it on the order of approximately 2,000 years.
that's around the time the 13 tribes first left kobol.
roslin: let me see.
ruins?
what ruins?
this is an inhabited city.
look at the buildings.
buildings?
roslin: look.
elosha: what did you see? tell me, laura.
a dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it like spokes.
with something around it like columns, like a forum, like the forum on caprica, actually.
elosha: the forum in the opera house in the city of the gods on kobol.
this planet is kobol.
billy: kobol like kobol?
elosha: the birthplace of mankind.
where the gods and man lived in paradise.
until the exodus of the 13 tribes.
madam president, what's going on?
it's real.
the scriptures, the myths, the prophecies.
they're all real.
so say we all.
baltar: hello, lieutenant.
boomer: hey, doc.
this is a bad time, right?
no.
i'm just cleaning my gun.
boomer: what's going on?
i was going to ask you the same question.
baltar: actually, i was looking for lt.
thrace.
but sometimes, it's good to talk these things over.
no.
6: deep down, she knows she's a cylon.
but her conscious mind won't accept it.
sometimes i have these dark thoughts.
what kind of dark thoughts?
her model is weak.
always has been.
but in the end, she'll carry out her mission.
i don't know.
but i'm afraid i'm going to hurt someone.
i feel like i have to be stopped.
she can't be stopped.
she's a cylon.
no.
6: you can't help her, gaius.
but you could probably sleep with her.
that's what you want, right?
i'm not sure why sometimes we must embrace that which opens up for us.
embrace?
life can be a curse as well as a blessing.
you will believe me when i tell you there are far worse things than death in this world.
boomer: so you're saying baltar: no.
what i say is meaningless.
listen to your heart.
embrace that which you know to be the right decision.
you might be right.
this may be kobol.
we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet.
the scriptures tell us that kobol points the way to earth.
organise a ground survey team.
three raptors.
i want a complete survey of the ruins immediately.
apollo: yes, sir.
no.
6: you should go.
remember what i said, gaius?
you don't want to be here when it happens.
when what happens?
what would happen if i go? in fact, i think i'm going to volunteer for the survey party.
your presence won't be necessary, doctor.
thank you. i'm the vice president of the colony, selected in my own right.
and i feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary, commander.
as your chief science advisor, i have to analyse the samples the team brings, and it would be more efficient if i can gather the samples by myself.
unless you have any objection, madam president.
no objections.
thank you. we need to talk.
sure.
you okay? boomer: what do you think?
i think it's hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber.
i didn't forget.
sharon, what's going on?
i know things haven't been so great lately, but i wake up in the morning and i wonder who i am.
i wake up and wonder if i'm going to hurt someone.
sharon, you need help.
not from you.
you made that clear.
boomer: i'm on my own.
tyrol: no, you're not.
thanks for coming out, chief.
you're dismissed.
so according to the scriptures if we had the arrow of apollo, we could take it down to kobol, and we could use it to open the tomb of athena and find our way to earth.
i didn't know you were that religious.
neither did i.
roslin: something wrong with that?
adama: no.
it's just new.
there is no earth.
you understand that.
it would seem that we were wrong.
commander, just because you and i don't know where it is it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
madam president i am not trying to mock your faith, so please understand me.
these stories about kobol, gods the arrow of apollo they're just stories, legends, myths.
don't let it blind you to the reality that we face.
reality is that the cylon raider has been successfully jump-tested.
reality is that cylon technology obviously outstrips our own.
and reality is there is a good chance the raider can jump all the way back to caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to earth.
roslin: the real earth.
adama: the raider's a military asset.
i won't use it to go chasing some mythical arrow.
i'm sorry.
hot dog: i say we find kobol, count our blessings, and just stay there.
pilot: but the sacred scrolls say that this could guide us to earth.
right?
okay.
cut the chatter.
raptors and on me.
ftl's spun up and ready?
cally, hold onto your lunch.
crashdown: jump in ten nine, eight seven, six, five four, three two, one.
eco: jump complete, gentlemen.
bring the nose down, we should see the planet directly ahead.
what the hell is that?
oh, my god!  cartman!
get us out of here!
cartman: we got a fire in the turbine.
shutting it down!
baltar: put it down!
crashdown: out of the way! come on!
crashdown: get out of the seat, doc! tyrol: everybody hang on!
tyrol: can you jump us out? no, the out drive's been hit.
tyrol: socinus, get on the horn and tell raptor to jump back to galactica!
right now! jump back to galactica!
jump back to galactica, over.
you are ordered to jump back to galactica.
whenever they're within proximity of one another they send off a short iff burst.
essentially, they are cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves to any other cylon transponder.
damn nice work, lieutenant.
that's very good.
now that we know what they are, i want to test one in the raider.
dualla: draidus contact.
raptor 275, sir.
back early.
something's wrong.
tyrol: what the hell are you doing?
baltar: oh, god! tyrol: hang on!
baltar: god! oh, my god! tyrol: do it!
crashdown: everybody hit the deck!
tyrol: i can't see! tyrol: pull it up!
watch the hill!
crashdown: thanks for watching!
how many people did we lose?
apollo: ten souls aboard raptor 3. raptor 1, last visual contact was seen under power flight heading toward the surface.
we need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue.
tigh: starbuck's working on a plan using the captured raider to get a nuke into the base ship.
the raider?
when did this happen?
tigh: about 19 minutes ago.
she said she's working on the details and we'll have a report at 1400.
adama: go talk to starbuck right away.
apollo: my pleasure.
adama: and report back to me.
apollo: yes, sir. is there something to worry about, madam president?
why do you ask that? that look on your face.
not now.
starbuck: take that out. the chief said we need it, but i don't.
apollo: lt.
thrace, attention!
i gave you a command.
you will obey it.
attention!
you do not take your harebrained ideas to the xo without going through me first.
do you understand? yes, sir. at ease.
so what's the plan?
i'm putting an autopilot in the raider.
jump him to the base ship.
engage the autopilot, punch out.
get picked up by a raptor.
starbuck: the raider heads to the base ship.
except the transponder allows the raider to approach.
nuke goes off.
boom, sir.
might work.
might get you killed.
would you miss me, sir? i need every pilot i have.
even the screw-ups.
captain.
i'm really sorry.
billy: if you do this, it could threaten everything we've accomplished.
it may bring down the government and you don't have a right to risk that for a go on.
for a drug-induced vision of prophecy.
i am well aware of that.
but it would seem that the gods have a different plan.
roslin: would you please get me lt.
thrace?
can i get you some more water?
yes.
thanks.
you can't be serious.
roslin: all of this has happened before and will happen again.
that cylon you interrogated, he quoted that bit of scripture.
he also said that we would find kobol and kobol would show us the way, did he not?
yes, he did.
roslin: we have found kobol.
do you believe in the gods, lieutenant?
not that it's any of your business, but, yes, i believe.
lieutenant, i am not trying to put you on the defensive i would like you to think this through with me.
if you believe in the gods then you believe in the cycle of time that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again and again and again throughout eternity.
that's the way i was raised.
but that doesn't mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy-ass mission against orders.
may i tell you the part of the story that it would seem i am playing?
i am dying.
what?
i have terminal breast cancer.
i have six months at the outside to live, and i have only told three people so i'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself. of course.
are you saying that you are the scripture tells us a dying leader lead humanity to the promised land.
if you go back to caprica and bring me the arrow i will show us the way.
this is crazy.
people keep using that word. it is crazy.
perhaps.
that doesn't mean it isn't true.
and it may be our only chance.
our only chance to find earth.
the old man is our last chance to find earth.
he knows where it is. he said so. you were there.
the location is a secret.
but he is going to take us there.
commander adama has no idea where earth is. he never did. he made it up in order to give people hope.
you're lying.
go ask him.
i will.
starbuck: i need one more in-flight test for the autopilot and nav systems before i jump for kobol.
adama: right.
can i ask you a question, boss?
shoot.
how much longer till we reach earth?
it's hard to say.
you got a guess?
you know i don't like to guess.
are we getting closer?
i'm sure we are.
adama: good luck on the next test.
apollo.
starbuck.
i'm ready over here.
okay, starbuck.
the board is green.
copy that.
powering up for the autopilot test.
this is starbuck, request permission to speak with galactica actual.
starbuck wants to speak to you, sir.
she's on a scrambled channel.
go ahead.
i believed you.
believed in earth.
what are you doing, starbuck?
bringing home the cag, sir.
we can talk about this.
no, i don't think so.
i want you to remember one thing.
i do not regret anything that i did.
be sure that whatever you're going to do, you don't regret it later.
do you understand me?  i guess we'll find out.
commander, she's spinning up the raider's ftl drive.
tigh: what? this is an autopilot test, what the hell is she doing?
what are you doing, kara?
galactica.
apollo.
she just jumped away.
repeat.
starbuck and the raider just jumped away.
she wasn't scheduled for a jump test.
where the hell did she go?  home.
.
they cylons were created by man they rebelled they evolved there are many copies and they have a plan previously on battlestar galatica there's enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet.
but the star in the system is highly unstable.
if you can believe it on the verge of going supernova.
we just picked up four base ships inbound at high speed.
it's just a matter of time until the cylons find out what we're up to on this planet.
starbuck has gone down!
i am going after my wife!
-i can't let you do that, sam.
-i am not asking you for permission.
sergeant mathias.
what if i told you that your daughter was still alive?
i'd say you were lying.
she's on our base ship right now.
she's ill, and we don't know why.
i mean, i don't even know how i found this place.
i just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly here it is.
the scriptures say this temple is the final resting place of the eye of jupiter.
what exactly are we talking about?
it's a marker that was left behind by the 13th tribe.
it's supposed to point the way to earth.
we want the eye of jupiter.
make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface, i'll launch every nuke i've got.
major, you've got to hold off the cylons until chief finds the eye of jupiter.
if it looks like they're gonna get into the temple your order is to blow it.
we have to go down to the planet.
i am so close to seeing the faces of the last five cylons.
the final five revealed only to those who enter the temple.
only to the chosen one.
the chosen one.
we just picked up six heavy raiders heading down toward the planet.
order nuclear ground-strike missiles i'm not gonna let the cylons get their hands on the eye.
are we prepared to sacrifice lee? missiles are loaded, admiral.
release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
mr.gaeta disable, launch, and warhead safeties on tubes through 10. safeties disabled.
warheads are armed.
x.o please input your  code.
these nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 klicks of the temple.
i know.
he's gonna do it.recall
the raiders immediately.
we agree.
bring them back.
we agree.after
all this time we can't afford to lose everything.
we agree.
bring them back.
algae planet base camp if kara dies out there i swear to gods, i will kill you myself.
if she dies out there, i'll let you.
so what are we gonna do now follow me around with a gun? because that is the only way that i am not going after kara.
private sykes.
sir? get lieutenant dualla on the line.
yes.sir i'm here.observation
post do you have eyeballs on starbuck's position?
negative, we have no visual on her raptor but i can see smoke from the crash site.
she went down behind a hill a couple klicks away.
can you get to the raptor?
i don't know.it's
pretty far away there's minimal cover. is it doable?
i don't know.
key.
standing by.
launch sequence set to auto.
they want the key to finding earth as much as we do. he won't just destroy it.
we spoke, and the decision's been made.
fire on my mark.
sir, the raiders are turning back.
-not all of them.
-uh, correction.
five have turned back.
one is still en route back to the planet.
what are you doing? he won't launch against just one ship.
-he won' -that's not the issue.
we made a decision.
d'anna has to turn back.
no,call d'anna and baltar.
na, turn them around now. what do you mean, no? this is something that we have to do. he won't launch over one ship.you'll
see.
you want me you want me to rescue captain thrace?
attempt the rescue.
yes, sir.
foxfire one out.
we go.
weapons are still hot, admiral.
safe all missiles.close
down the doors.
there.you
see? never over just one ship.
that is not a good sign, my friends.
she defied us, defied the group.
it's not about in the eye of jupiter.
it's about her. it's like we don't even know them anymore.
we may have to so something about this.
we may have to do it sooner than later.
hera's alive.
i'm her mother, and i'm going to get her.
sharon, baby, listen to me, okay?
we could take a raptor we can fly to the base ship ourselves.
i don't-- i don't care anymore.
we can't.
we'll find another way.
we will.
there is no other way.
don't ask me to do this, sharon.
listen to me.
you have always been the strong one.
you believed in us when no one else would.
i'm begging you to do this.
find the courage to do this for both of us, okay?
i love you.
i love you too. in search of a home called earth -wait outside.
-yes,sir sharon's downloading into another body aboard a cylon ship right now, isn't she? she begged me.
she begged me to do it.
gods, if you'd seen the look in her eyes when i-- she has important information on our defenses.
codes, procedures, the tactical situation down on the planet's surface.
the cylons have access to all of that as well.
she won't betray us.
you know that.
it's why you gave her the uniform.
she may not have a choice.
did you consider that?
she says she could resist that she wouldn't let it happen.
she'll get hera and she'll come back.
that's quite a leap of faith you've made, there, captain.
and if it involved your family only i'd say it was brave.
but you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy are you aware of that?
if you hadn't lied and stolen our baby in the first place we wouldn't be here at all.
i certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment.
and there's plenty of blame to throw around, and i accept it.
and now all of our lives are in the hands of sharon agathon.
all we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, captain.
and you as well, admiral.
can you tell me what happened?
they wouldn't let me see my daughter so my husband shot me. it was the only way.
well, it's over now. the important thing is that you're here.
how's my daughter?
she's getting worse.
i want to see her. and then what? what they did to me stealing my baby and telling me she was dead you proved it.
hera's safer here and so am i. all right, before she went down starbuck spotted about 15-plus chrome jobs advancing on us from here.
to get to us, the toasters have to come through this canyon.
this is a natural choke point.
that's where we'll ambush them guerilla style.
our mission is to hold the temple here.
if we fail, we blow it up.
we fall back to these rendezvous points.
and then we head into the mountains and we wait for rescue.
well, it's a good a place as any to die, i suppose.
what do you think?
well it was a nice day for a walk.
snipers!
hey, take it easy, fischer.
sarge?
sarge?
oh, gods! oh, it's just crazy.
come on, think, think.
galen, it's major adama.
sir.
chief, we're in position.
any luck finding the eye of jupiter?
no, major.i
need more time.
get on it.
the cylons are on the move we'll hold them off as long as we can.
apollo out.
okay, people, listen up.xxxxx -it's so close.
-i know.
the answers to all your questions are down there in that temple.
what's wrong?
i'm worried, gaius.
this is what we've been waiting for.
you are the anointed one.
chosen by god to look on the faces of the final five cylons.
it's already written.
you will succeed.
that's what i'm afraid of.
to know the face of god is to know madness.
the hybrid had looked into the space between life and death.
and she's seen things that we cannot conceive of.
but she's been driven mad as a result.
have faith in god.
put your life in his hands.
he will guide you to your destiny.
i'm grateful to you.
for everything.
her destiny will part company from yours, gaius.
she's not the chosen one.
you are.
yes, i know.
i know.
-ready?
-i got it okay, we're set.
and now we wait.
what happens if the cylons don't dance to the major's tune?
what happens is we get splattered all over these rocks.
shut up.this is his game, not ours.
we just do what we're told, and maybe we get out of here.
you really think these civvies can stop them?
well, they stopped plenty of them on caprica when we were running for our lives.
okay, three clankers just entered our kill zone.
gotta be their recon element.
sykes, give 'em the signal.
all right, showtime, showtime.
they're headed our way.
don't detonate till they're all the way in.
wait for it.
come on, you sons of bitches.
come on.
now, now, now, now.
look out! aah!man down!
cease fire! they're pulling back!they're pulling back!
oh, frak! gods damn it!
come on!
damn it.
oh, frak, frak.
okay, this man's dead.we
gotta pull him back.
sam, pull it together.
we bought ourselves a little time but they'll be back.and
with force.
so dig in.
we'll need to hold them off until chief finds the eye.
and keep your eyes out on those ridges.
you have any word from kara or dee? no.
starbuck?
-star-- -dee, why the hell didn't you sing out? i almost blew you away.
yeah.glad to see you too.
okay, okay.
it's okay, yeah.
uhh! lee sent you? yep.
my husband ordered me to risk my life for yours.
that's what i'm gonna do.
i'm gonna bring starbuck back to apollo.
she's here.
it's me.
it's mommy.
yes.
what's wrong?
we tried everything.
she didn't respond.
look at that.
hera knows her.
that's amazing.
you and she are biologically identical.
hera recognizes her mother.
well, good, because you can have her.
i'm done with her.
you don't mean that.
i know you still care about tyrol and adama.
no.
i'm done with that part of my life.
i learned that on new caprica.
humans and cylons were not meant to be together.
we should just go our separate ways.
wanna lay down?
her belly's as hard as a rock.
have you noticed that before?
what do you think that means?
blocked intestine, maybe.
our doctors examined her.
well, your doctors have never examined a child.
hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.
i need to take her back to galactica.
you know that can't happen, what this child means to us.
what she means to every living cylon.
i should have known.she's
been planning this all alone.
feel her.
she's right.
belly's as hard as a gourd.
if you don't let me take her the first of a new generation will die.
god will never forgive you.
maybe cavil's right.
maybe god never wanted us to have children in the first place.
maybe it'd be better for you if i just snapped your little neck!
don't!
please.
please don't kill my baby girl.
honey, oh.
i believe the future of the cylon rests with this child.
and the others who are gonna come after her.
so do i.
there's a captured raptor aboard.
let's go.
we've gotta get you back to galactica.
here they come.
open fire! tell 'em to blow the thing! the cylons are closing in! it's the major.
-tyrol.
-tell me you've found the eye of jupiter.
no, but i'm getting close, major.
i've deciphered some more of the glyphs.
i got a reference to an eye something about a star, and an  of some kind.
all right, cut to the chase, chief.
do you have the eye of jupiter in your hands or not?
no, major.
oh, cylon!
it's hot!
all right, chief, listen to me: that's it!
get your people to the rally point and blow the temple.
i repeat, blow the temple.
yes, sir.damn it.
all right, fall back!
mathias, fall back!
fall back!fall back!
all right, that's it, everybody.
drop what you're doing and get out.
that means you, too, cally.come
on!
leave the gear!go! if i only had a little more time.
galen it's in the hands of the gods now, galen.
let's go.
there's nothing we can do! the ship's structurally intact.
okay.
that means that the only thing kee us grounded is the busted fly-by-wire.
so you gotta bypass those bundles with datacord from the com system.
and then we we may have a shot at getting out of here.
god! there's only one left.
better save it for when you fly us out of here.
i can't fly.
especially all whacked up on morph.
well, that's just frakkin' great. he won't cheat.
he's too honorable.
unlike you.
yeah, unlike me.
i love sam.
i hate sam.
i love lee.
i hate lee.
gods, i have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
stay with it.
you still gotta walk me through these avionics.
the cylons have reached the temple.
chief, what's your status? i'm wiring the last detonator.
the eye of jupiter has to be somewhere in this temple.
they've wired it with explosives.
let's disconnect it.
pull out the detonators.
quickly.
chief, blow this thing!
you out of your frakkin' mind?
i can't do it.
gaius!
yes? help us!
yeah.
give me the control!
this just about does it.
frak! what have you done?
what have you done?
major, look.
what is that?
there it is, gaius.
it has the answers to all of your questions.
that's the eye?
what is? oh, uh something the hybrid said, uh sapphire blue.
shining like unto a star.
d'anna you didn't come here looking for earth.
you came here looking for something else.
picking up massive energy pulse from the central star.
sir, it's a helium flash.the
star's going nova.
nova's gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.
major, look.
it's the mandala from the temple.
this is supposed to be happening.
that's it.
i was staring at it the whole time.
the sun is going nova. the nova is the eye of jupiter.
all right, we can still blow it.
we can still blow it.
we just gotta make it into orbit.
galactica will find us from there, okay?
ok good.
this is my destiny.
to see what lies between life and death.
and to look upon the faces of the final five.
that can't happen.
this is my destiny.
sorry, d'anna.
the final five. is it really you? you.
forgive me, i-- i had no idea.
no idea about what? what did you see? what who was it?
it was beautiful.
what was? tell me!am i one of you? you were right.
about what? d'anna, did you see my face?
i have to know, please.
please, stay with me.stay, i have to know! tell me, i have to know!did you see my face?! am i a cylon?
frak.
god, tell me the truth before i die.
welcome home, mr.president.
admiral, the cylon fleet just jumped away.
they don't wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here.
neither do we.
launch a rescue mission, now.
we don't have much time before the nova fries everything in the system.
it's gonna be a photo finish.
all rescue ships from the planet accounted for.
count us down!
-commence ftl.
-commence ftl.
jump in three two one.
i got it.
he's not dead?
no, unfortunately.
take him to the bridge.
hi.
we have to get her to doc cottle right away.
okay.
xxxxx hold your fire!hold your fire.
she helped us escape.
get out of the way! lieutenant sharon i think the chief is right.
i think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this temple.
do you think the 13th tribe had a vision of what was to come?
i don't know what else it could mean.
maybe they saw another nova, and drew a picture of that.
you've seen one nova, you've seen them all.
there was another nova.
seen 4,000 years ago, around about when the temple might have been built.
it's 13,000 light years from our present position.
it's a cloud of gas known as the ionian nebula.
maybe it was a road sign showing the direction that they headed to next.
so starbuck, tell me, is that what you gotta do to get a little extra rack time around here? did you just come by to frak with me? actually, i wanted to know if you had any, uh pictures of your old apartment on caprica.
um yeah.
uh the locker, top shelf.
cigar box.
why? i'm curious about something.
well, i hope you and sharon aren't planning on redecorating, 'cause you're not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.
oh, i remember.
i've seen better looking train wrecks.
oh, thank you. but i do remember those paintings you did.
what about them? this was on the temple.
where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
i don't know.
it was just something i've been doodling since i was a kid.
i liked the pattern.
well they built the temple 4,000 years ago.
what is it?
just something leoben said once. that i had a destiny.
that it had already been written.
ahh.
you know the drill.
long, deep, controlled breathing.
at least you'll never have to go through this again.
the decision wasn't easy, but the conclusion was inevitable.
your model is fundamentally flawed.
no.
it's not a flaw to question your purpose.
is it?
to wonder who programmed us, the way we think and why? well, that's the problem right there. the messianic conviction that you're on a special mission to enlighten us.
look at the damage it's caused.
i would do it all again.
yes, we know.
that's why we've decided to box your entire line.
your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had are going into cold storage.
indefinitely.
one must die to know the truth.
there are five other cylons, brother.
i saw them.
one day, you're gonna see them too.
one day.
good-bye.
brother one day.
brother.
narrator: previously on battlestar galactica.
just do it.
crashdown: boomer, this could be it.
this is the little planet that solves all of our problems.
elosha: what did you see? roslin: a dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it.
this planet is kobol.
organise a ground survey team.
three raptors.
they're everywhere!
we're not getting out of here!
we need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue.
if you go back to caprica and bring me the arrow i will show us the way.
what are you doing, starbuck?
galactica.
apollo.
she just jumped away.
where the hell did she go? home.
crashdown: this is it!
now, come on!
now come on!
everybody up! crashdown: come on!
go! crashdown: come on, move!
out! tyrol: come on, get him out of the chair.
crashdown: look at me. tyrol: i got him!
crashdown: for gods' sakes, hurry!
tyrol: come on!
tyrol: i got his legs.
crashdown: i got him!
tyrol: put him on your shoulder.
crashdown: doc! come on, doc! crash!
doc!  no.
6: take my hand.
gaius, take my hand.
hey, come on!
wake up! stay with me! we gotta go! stay with me, doc! come on!
cally: come on!
bring him outside!
it's gonna blow!  crashdown: get down!
stay down.
tyrol: how's he? you okay? we got full tanks.
let's see what we get.
getting them down.
cally: you all right?
you okay? crashdown: get the supplies before they burn.
go.
cally: right away.
tyrol: we crashed both tanks.
the gas is gone.
it's all gone.
it's a museum.
so what?
it's more than that.
it's the home of the arrow of apollo.
helo: what the hell is that?
boomer 1: you never liked history.
come on, helo.
it's supposed to be the only clue as to the location of earth.
earth?
what are you talking about?
who's going to earth? it doesn't even exist.
i'm trying to get back to galactica.
what i need from you is a way off this planet, and a way back to my ship.
if you don't do that, i'll blow your head off.
why don't you just shut up for a change?
you're only alive because i've kept you alive.
if it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now.
so whether you like it or not, i'm your only hope of getting off this planet.
so if i were you, i'd take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass.
we can't move around the city during daylight.
so we hole up and we wait till dark.
unbelievable.
she's crossed the line before, but this is so far beyond the pale she wouldn't have done this on her own.
she was coerced.
no one coerces starbuck.
believe me, i've tried.
commander, i have the president on the line.
adama: bear witness.
put on your headset.
adama: madam president, moments ago, lt. thrace took the cylon raider on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump.
yes.
do you have any knowledge of this incident?
let's save some time here, commander.
the question you really want to ask me is whether or not i asked lt.
thrace to take the raider to caprica.
roslin: the answer to your question is yes.
you and i had talked about this.
yes, we had.
adama: we both decided it was a military decision.
my responsibility as president is first and foremost to protect and preserve this fleet and its future.
in the end, that outweighs any other consideration.
it has to.
by taking the raider you've placed our people on the surface of kobol in direct danger.
roslin: i'm very aware of the danger our men and women are in on kobol.
i am also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in if i ignore the pursuit of this arrow.
i'm going to have to ask you for your resignation, madam president.
roslin: no. then i'm terminating your presidency as of this moment.
commander adama, i will exercise the authority of this office until i am unable to do so.
so if you want to stage a coup you're gonna have to come over here and arrest me.
i don't want any bloodshed.
of course you don't.
neither do i.
neither does the press.
they're here, by the way.
the press.
they're recording every minute.
what is it, captain?
isolate colonial one.
mr.
gaeta.
jam any transmissions in or out of colonial one immediately.
yes, sir.
prepare a strike team.
as long as she's president, she's dangerous.
if she can turn starbuck against us, she's capable of anything.
yes, sir.
she's bluffing.
well, let's hope so.
there's also a cylon base ship out there to deal with.
leave that to me.
this government survived a cylon attack.
it will survive william adama.
roslin: i think he's bluffing.
but just in case, we need to be prepared.
i know their security detail.
they will defend that ship.
we'll have to take her down compartment by compartment.
adama: mr.
gaeta?
gaeta: sir.
am i correct in assuming that i have two cylon transponders left?
yes, sir.
but only one of them is fully functional.
one will do.
now i need a pilot.
boomer: sir.
adama: as you were.
how are you feeling? it looks worse than it is, sir.
things are moving very quickly and i need every pilot.
i'm ready, sir.
i have a very special mission for you and i won't kid around.
it's high risk, extremely high risk.
i understand.
adama: i need you to light-jump to kobol and take care of this base star.
we're placing a cylon transponder aboard your raptor. in theory, it should allow you to approach the base star without getting fired upon.
but we'll still be id'd as colonial raptors once we're in visual range.
for all they know, you could be two cylon agents returning with a captured raptor.
adama: once you're inside the defence perimeter i need you to make them think you want to dock.
you have to fire your nuke into the loading bay and then jump back home immediately.
do you understand? i understand.
i can do it, sir.
i know i can.
you have to.
yes, sir.
starbuck: this doesn't look good.
please tell me this was not all for nothing.
i'm good.
i am really good.
i'm home.
wow, i'm home.
gaeta, please tell me that you're right about this transponder thing.
stop.
stop that.
i'm nervous.
like anything scares you.
things scare me, helo.
i have feelings.
you have software.
i don't know if you can hear this or not, helo but what we had between us was important.
it was very important.
why? because it was the next step.
because it brings us closer to god.
don't mock the gods.
it's a human belief.
i'm human.
they're our gods.
but beyond that, i just want you to know that i genuinely feel something for you.
i don't care.
i don't love you.
i loved what i thought was you.
helo, i think there's something else that you should know.
i'm pregnant.
apollo:  galactica, apollo.
we have visual on colonial one.
tell apollo he's cleared to begin the assault to contact us when he has soft-seal on the hull.
aye, sir.
commander, boomer and racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to kobol.
put them through down here.
adama: boomer, galactica actual.
i just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and i have complete faith in the both of you.
thank you, actual.
we won't let you down.
racetrack, start the jump clock.
clock is running.
apollo: galactica.
apollo.
we have soft-seal.
i know commander adama and i'm counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, he is the kind of man who will not want bloodshed.
nevertheless, this may not be the safest place.
billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold?
there is room in the cargo hold and i implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians.
this is my choice.
roslin: this is my choice.
you do not have to come with me.
we stand with our president.
billy: yes? right.
security commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull.
the raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
get the president on the line.
you think this thing is working?
we're about to find out.
i guess so.
yeah.
how are we doing on that?
it's not responding, sir.
are you even trained to use this thing?
crashdown: how's he doing, chief?
not doing so good.
i don't now if his lungs are burned or what.
well, he's a tough kid.
he's gonna pull through.
get those wounds looked at, chief.
tyrol: yeah.
lieutenant?
tyrol: shouldn't we be moving out? do you have a plan for tactical deployment?
plan for tactical deployment, chief?
get to the high ground.
it'll be our best chance of being seen by a search party.
high ground is also our best chance of being seen by the cylons.
tyrol: they're flying around, sir.
they might land the troops before we get rescued.
crashdown: that's true.
tyrol: yeah.
sir, if i may suggest that we take cover on the ground maybe somewhere we won't be seen from the air?
okay, yeah.
chief, that's carry on, chief.
launch the nuke and prepare to jump.
frack.
what? the bomb release is jammed.
i can't free it.
we can dock inside the ship.
excuse me? they think we're cylons.
they'll let us dock.
we can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself.
it'll work.
i know it.
oh, my gods.
tyrol: petard, felix?
tyrol: wanna give me a hand here, please?
felix: yes, sir.
tyrol: cally, how's he doing?
cally: not good, sir.
tyrol: get a blanket on him.
keep him warm.
no.
6: how are you?
baltar: alive.
you saved me.
you saved my life.
care to return the favour?
are you in need of saving?
you wondered why you were chosen?
why god chose you above all other humans to survive and serve his purpose?
now is the time to find out why.    lords of kobol, hear our prayer.
bring us out of the darkness and into the light.
give us the strength to show mercy to those who are merciless the president says she will not yield.
hearts that they may find peace the president says she will not yield.
so be it.
come on, d, tell me he's not actually gonna do this.
tell me she's not gonna make him do it.
redeem our hearts that they may find peace in the midst of war.
what's going on?
they're in.
roslin: quickly.
billy?
billy?
sir, they're in.
pretty, isn't it?
hello, lieutenant.
something i can help you with?   i'm setting her down.
open the hatch.
boomer: i'll release the bomb.
boomer: keep the engines ready for takeoff the second i get back.
yes, sir.
close the hatch after me.
lf i'm not back in five minutes, just go.
you got it.
boomer: oh, my god.
no.
6: welcome back to caprica, lieutenant.
like what we've done with the place?
boomer 2: sharon.
racetrack: what the frack are you doing?
where are you going?
son of a bitch.
okay, okay.
all: sharon.
this isn't happening.
come on, starbuck.
got anything left?
starbuck?
madam president, no one needs to get hurt here.
then why don't you get off my ship, colonel?
i'm placing you under arrest.
no.
we're not doing this.
i'm in command here, captain.
colonel, this is wrong.
you're relieved.
fall back.
madam president, i wish to apollo: men, lay down your weapons.
tigh: have you lost your fracking mind?
colonel, tell these marines to fall back.
tigh: this is mutiny.
you know that.
apollo: yes, i do.
apollo: but you can tell my father i'm listening to my instincts.
and my instincts tell me we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the president makes a bad decision.
put your guns down.
madam president, stand back.
put your gun down, captain.
i will not have bloodshed, neither your men nor my people on the colonial one.
put your gun down.
all of you.
please, put your gun down.
tigh: let's go.
marine: let's go, captain.
let's go.
boomer 2: you're confused.
and scared.
but it's okay.
i'm not a cylon.
i'm sharon valerii.
i was born on troy.
my parents were katherine and abraham valerii.
you can't fight destiny, sharon.
it catches up with you.
no matter what you do.
boomer 3: don't worry about us.
boomer 4: we'll see you again.
we love you, sharon.
and we always will.
racetrack: boomer!
boomer: come on, let's go! racetrack: what took you so long?
boomer: go! racetrack: where's your helmet?
go back.
don't turn around.
he put his weapon right to my head. said to tell you he was following his instincts whatever the hell that means.
adama: bring him here.
tigh: what about roslin?
we put her in the brig.
dradis contacts!
it's boomer and racetrack, sir.
put them on the speakers.
boomer:  galactica, boomer.
mission accomplished.
repeat: mission accomplished.
the base star is history!
there's some good news.
bring them home, d. it's good to hear your voice, boomer.
come on home.
helo: it's okay.
i can't believe it.
you are like the last person i expected to see.
i could say the same thing about you.
you okay? yeah, thank you.  i missed you.
hey, i  starbuck: she's a cylon!
helo: no! you can't! she's pregnant.
no!  i know this place.
of course you do.
go inside.
i don't understand.
life has a melody, gaius.
a rhythm of notes that become your existence once they're played in harmony with god's plan.
it's time to do your part and realise your destiny.
which is what, exactly?
you are the ian and protector of the new generation of god's children. the first member of our family will be with us soon, gaius.
it's time to make your choice.
but i don't understand what you're talking about.
i don't understand.
come.
see the face of the shape of things to come.
isn't she beautiful, gaius?
open the cell.
close the cell.
marine: well done, lieutenant.
boomer: thanks.
gaeta: hey, nice work.
boomer: thanks.
what's going on?
gaeta: a lot happened while you were gone.
gaeta: congrats.
boomer: thanks.
congratulations to both of you.
you carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission and you did it despite any personal misgivings you may or may not have had.
and for that, i'm very proud.
adama: thank you. racetrack: thank you, sir.
thank you, sir.
thank you.   apollo: someone get a doctor!
hold his head.
.
previously, on battlestar galactica citizens, i give you your new vice-president, doctor gaius baltar.
you're the father of my child.
and nothing is ever gonna change that.
i know a place where you can stay, where you will be safe.
how much time do i have weeks, a month at the outside.
unless the cancer goes to your brain.
that happens, you i'm afraid the tests are positive.
the mass is malignant.
it's advanced well beyond the left breast.
i'm afraid the test is positive.
ms.
roslin the surgery, of course, to remove the mass secretary roslin yes naylin stans from the education alliance.
you said you wanted to talk yes.
i'm sorry, mr.
stans i have to admit, i was surprised to get your message.
the president was surprised i sent it.
once our chief negotiator got a billy club to the head, we figured adar's government had written us off as a lost cause.
i was a teacher long before i was secretary of education, and causes are only lost when we give up.
madame president can you hear me let's make her as comfortable as we can.
oh, gods season - episode 13 'epiphanies' starbuck zero four niner cap is away.
galactica, roger that.
zero four niner.
save flight.
safe and 20 frackin' minutes late.
did you have a rough night, starbuck you're way out of line.
just follow my lead and save the attitude for someone who cares.
kat six seven zero, roger that.
request permission to clear guns.
roger that, kat.
clear your throat.
damn it.
weapons malfunction.
galactica.
kat, you good i'm good, i'm good.
what the hell just happened your wing gun's out.
just keep it steady, we're heading home.
galactica, this is starbuck.
i'm declaring an emergency.
we've got two bent birds.
requesting priority clearance to land.
starbuck, galactica.
flight deck is yours.
why don't you just shoot us in the locker room, chief save the wear and tear on the ships.
kat's guns are clean, i checked 'em myself.
yeah, well i don't believe in accidents.
chief.
something's not right.
the weight's off, it's too light.
i found three more just like it.
mixed in with the regular rounds.
casing's been weakened.
falls apart in the barrel.
next one hits it bang, she's lucky she didn't lose her whole wing.
one bad round's a fluke.
more than one, sabotage.
pull 'em all.
all right you heard the chief, lets pull 'em all.
go.
how's the president doing, doc she's dying and she knows it.
i offered her a shot of morpha to ease the pain, but she wouldn't hear of it.
tests are positive.
mr.
president the terrorists mr.
president, we should at least speak with the strikers before sending in the troops.
they're teachers, not terrorists.
they're acting like thugs.
their last demonstration put two policemen in the hospital.
six of them have chained themselves outside the hall of education.
as far as i'm concerned, they're criminals.
their pay is substandard, their schools are falling apart and the strike action has been gaining momentum for months and you know that.
i don't understand why we're not at least talking to them.
one of the most interesting things about being president is that you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
you've already set a meeting with stans, haven't you obviously, only if you approve, mr.
president.
she's really not in a fit state to do anything let alone conduct any government business.
don't talk about me as if i'm not here.
there'll be plenty of time for that soon enough.
billy, could you of course.
gentlemen, i called you here to discuss the cylon.
dr.
cottle, would you would you please tell them what you told me this morning i'm no expert in genetics, but i can read a blood test.
that cylon fetus is showing some very peculiar genetic abnormalities.
i haven't seen any of this on your report, doctor.
no well, as dr.
cottle says, he's not an expert, and i am i've been through the tests and i wouldn't say that there was anything conclusive.
didn't say conclusive, just damned odd.
right.
madame president.
as you know, the sharon cylon is of considerable tactical value to the fleet.
perhaps you've gotten too close to your subject, doctor.
this is difficult, so i'm going to cut right to it.
allowing this thing to be born could have frightening consequences.
for the security of this fleet, i believe the cylon pregnancy must be terminated before it is too late.
madame president, i'd like i thought you of all people would understand, admiral.
madame president.
i don't understand, this makes no sense.
one of the interesting things about being president is you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.
thank you, gentlemen, i'm a little tired.
gentlemen.
i don't want to seem alarmist, but i am perturbed.
i think that the president's illness is affecting her judgment.
especially when it comes to the subject she seemed reasonably coherent to me.
then i'll have to appeal to you on scientific grounds.
destroying this child would seriously impact my studies of the cylon sub-species.
the president made the call and i'm backing her. with all due respect, the president made the call based on evidence presented by dr.
cottle, pull yourself together.
you're about to become president of the colonies.
you're going to be asked to make some very hard decisions.
act like you can handle it.
gods where have you been where have i been i never left you, gaius.
oh, right, yeah, yeah, metaphorically speaking.
it's just that it was weeks ago, and i, i'm sure you've suffered mightily in my absence.
you know, jealousy is a really ugly emotion.
what is this lingering controversy over my affair with your three-dimensional duplicate.
i'm not jealous, i'm concerned.
oh yeah, concerned, about what? our child.
now you're concerned?
well, for your information, the president intends to kill it.
once roslin's gone, you'll be president.
you can use your new authority to save our child.
oh, like that's gonna did you see the way adama looked at me? the contempt on his face?
i will be the president, all right, but without the military support, i might as well be an anointed dog catcher.
yes, well, you have your own resources if you'd use them.
what you don't know what i mean?
no, i don't know what you mean. the nuclear device.
the one adama provided for your research.
there is one way.
i didn't want to have to ask you for this.
but what i really need to complete the project is a nuclear warhead. is a nuclear warhead.
you're totally insane.
i'm trying to help you, you idiot.
if adama remains committed to the destruction of our child, it may be our only hope.
there's no easy way to say this.
it's about the cylon.
the president has decided that her pregnancy will be terminated.
what?
why? doc cottle discovered some anomalies in the fetal blood work.
isn't that expected?
maybe.
but the president believes that to allow the baby to come to full term constitutes an unacceptable risk to the fleet.
i don't understand.
sharon's only helped us since she came back from caprica.
she even turned on her own.
to save her life.
don't mistake the will the live for genuine compassion, lieutenant.
she's still the enemy.
does she know?
not yet.
then i should be the one to tell her. if that's all, sir helo.
i don't expect you to agree to the decision.
but i need you to accept it.
we're talking about my child, sir. a part of me.
but i guess it's easier to kill when you call it a cylon.
dismissed.
so you're saying someone's been tampering with our ammunition.
shells don't unload themselves.
what's this i hear about you ordering both galactica and pegasus fighters to stand down?
price you pay for reinstating me as cag, sir.
maybe that was a mistake.
maybe i don't give a damn what you think.
take it easy, both of you.
fact is, we've been sharing stories between the ships.
and nobody flies combat until our ammo supplies check out.
leaving us defenseless if the cylons decide to pick a fight.
we were defenseless before this, we just didn't know about it.
lee, find out who did this.
all right.
excuse me, i'm looking for asha janik.
asha, she's over there.
let's do this quietly.
asha janik?
captain adama.
i have a message for your father.
they may take me.
okay, stop her.
but i am one of many.
we have declared war against galactica's armies of death.
the cylons aren't our true enemy.
it's the military that refuses to negotiate.
all we want is peace.
demand peace.
demand peace.
so much for being discreet?
we found these pamphlets in janik's quarters.
some kind of a manifesto.
demand peace from the cylons?
who the hell are these people?
cylon sympathizers.
just had no idea they were this organized.
i want to know how she got aboard my ship.
the hangar deck's short-staffed.
we've been forced to import civilians to handle some of the grunt work.
apparently she's, um, she's a picon, worked maintenance on the greenleaf, no known criminal affiliations.
until now, now listen to this: 'do not be afraid, we are not terrorists, but we will not sit back while adama's war machine continues to press us into cruel and futile conflict.'
gods damn it.
'our demonstrations worked.
news is already spreading across the fleet.' i know.
we were contacted by a person claiming to speak for the subversives demanding a meeting on the galactica.
they've got stones, i'll give them that.
well, i've agreed.
what?
we're not negotiating.
i just want to know what we're up against.
are you all right, madame secretary?
considering the stakes, you don't seem particularly engaged.
the stakes are what we decide to make them, mr.
stans.
if the president uses troops to enforce us back to work order, people will get hurt.
even die.
some causes are worth dying for.
not this one.
the mass is malignant.
doctor.
admiral, i am royan jahee.
you have a unique way of welcoming visitors to your ship.
visitor, my ass.
we shoot people like you for treason.
colonel, i'm only an interested party trying to prevent more bloodshed.
i deplore what happened aboard your vipers.
how many sympathizers do we have aboard this fleet?
if you're trying to crush an organization, you can stop now.
the people in this movement are following an idea, not a leader.
what the hell do they want?
peace with the cylon.
you want us to surrender?
they attacked us.
only after we'd enslaved them.
you call yourselves military men, strategists.
explain to me how our current course of attack and retreat leads to victory?
you can play innocent bystander, but i think you know more than you're telling us.
either way, you're a danger to this fleet.
admiral, arresting me isn't going to stop any of this.
maybe not.
but it's a start.
take him away.
all right, get your rubber gloves on.
this is everything from the janik woman's quarters.
somehow the admiral thinks looking through this crap's gonna tell us something new about their so-called movement.
so haven't seen much of you since your space walk.
hold it.
what is this?
what's a deckhand need with a portable library reader? the daru mozu.
a tylium refinery.
and janik's used to explosives.
this is the cag.
get me a tac team ready, right now.
i don't understand, why are they doing this now?
i don't know.
the admiral said they found something in the baby's blood.
somehow, president roslin considers it a threat to the fleet.
it can't just be that.
i've done nothing but help them since i've come here.
i've held back my anger.
i've tried to show them that cylons are not all the same.
that we're not all murderers.
deep down, i think they're still afraid of you.
yeah afraid.
they wanna be afraid of something?
yeah?
just let them come.
let'em.
let them try to take my baby.
just let them try to take my baby.
sharon, stop.
sharon, please don't do this.
please.
listen to me, listen to me.
listen to me.
sharon, look at me. let'go.
easy, easy.
when we land, move fast.
we're looking for explosive devices set near the daru's ftl drive.
captain, i'm getting something on the wireless i think it's coming from the daru mozu.
none of us want to die, but the fighting must end.
if my sacrifice sends a signal to the cylon that brings peace, then it was worth it.
i do this for my children, and for the children that will follow them.
gods willing, demand peace.
pull out, pull out.
demand peace.
pull out, pull out, pull out.
people are dead.
i grieve for them, admiral.
and i assure you, the tylium's ship's just a taste of what's in store, unless someone starts listening.
you listen and you listen well.
i don't care if i have to interrogate every civilian on board this fleet.
this is gonna stop.
do you understand yes.
mr.
vice president, president roslin insisted on your taking the tour.
she'd like the transition to go as smoothly as possible.
what are these cylon agent suspects, sir.
that number means everything to her. represents hope, that's our future.
yes, yes.
being the president is, a lot of responsibility.
it's tradition for outgoing presidents to leave a letter for their successor.
it's usually opened on the first day of the new term, but the next few days are liable to prove hectic, so well, let's just pray that she gets better.
let's.
excuse me.
yes.
mr.
vice president hello?
yes.
yes.
i understand.
thank you. i was told i might meet an old friend here.
it's good to see you, gaius.
so you've become a member of the peace movement well, despite what you may think, i've always abhorred violence.
would you excuse us please.
do they have any idea what you are of course not, even their dedication has limits.
i miss you.
you look amazing.
i can't believe how real you are.
what're you doing i haven't stopped thinking about you since the second i left the pegasus.
no, no i can't get you out of my head.
don't do this, not yet gaius.
i can't help myself, i can't.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm just not ready.
so, is there any reason in particular for inviting me around here because you saved me.
let me save you.
here we go again.
what are you talking about you must sense it.
gaius, the fleet's c.
people are turning on each other.
there are serious misgivings about the military.
when you're president, you can use the office to turn them against adama, paving the way for the cylons to save us.
i would love to be with you always, but i know it's hard, but it's the only way.
no.
i am not who you think i am. and i will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind.
if you would have caught it sooner, maybe we could have done more.
laura, come in.
i didn't like the way we left things this morning.
richard, i i know.
you've been thinking this is a mistake for a while now.
i just met with stans.
the education alliance is going to back off.
back off laura, what did you give them i made them a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievances, richard.
i thought you'd be happy they're going back to work.
you've put me in a very awkward position.
i don't see how. both sides gave ground.
it's not just about your teachers.
it's the next strike i'm worried about.
you just showed them that if they hold out long enough, this administration will cave.
you expected me to fail.
i expected you to hold the line.
this doesn't have to be the end of the world.
you can stay on in an advisory capacity.
gods know we need your ideas.
you're asking me to resign i don't have any choice.
this isn't about you and me anymore.
you're right, it's not.
you were willing to attack those people and up until a few hours ago, i was prepared to let you.
i am on my way to the galactica to represent this administration.
when i return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight.
when i return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight.
notify the admiral.
this is admiral adama.
as you know, president roslin has been aboard galactica for the last few days.
she's a fighter.
but as of this moment, her prognosis is grave.
i know that many of you believe in the power of prayer.
if that is your way, then i urge you to pray for our president.
as for the others, i hope you will join me in kee her in our thoughts.
admiral, please don't do this.
stand down, everyone.
give me room.
think about what you're doing helo.
you're a soldier.
i'm a father, like you.
please, sir give me a raptor, let me take her off the ship.
i'll get her away from the fleet.
i can't do that, son.
admiral, admiral.
admiral.
doctor, get the hell outta here.
admiral, i must talk to you concerning the cylon child.
it seems i may have been wrong.
very wrong.
when i said that dr cottle misinterpreted the fetal blood work see, i had another look at those samples and i discovered something quite intriguing.
understand, cylon blood is virtually impossible to differentiate from our own.
that being said, obviously it has to be slightly different because the cylon is not human.
if, um if our blood looks like this for example.
and the cylon's blood looks like this then it's fair to assume that the cylon human is carrying an amalgam. is this a theory or fact? the cylon's fetus contains no antigens.
it has no blood type.
that's what dr cottle was talking about when he said it was damned odd.
except it's not damned odd, it's astonishing.
now, knowing as we do that the cylons are built slightly better to endure than their human counterparts, i wonder could the cylon blood also be blessed, shall we say blessed, with a heightened resistance to disease?
so, i applied a sample of sharon's fetal blood to some cancer cells i took from the president.
what am i looking at? nothing.
that's the whole point.
the cancer was gone and it was gone within a matter of hours.
are you saying you found a cure for the president's cancer?
well, it's untried.
it's obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous.
but, yes, it's possible.
if you abort sharon's fetus now, you'll never know.
now you may feel a sharp pain.
sharon, it's okay, it's gonna be all right.
i don't like what you're doing.
i think it's unnatural and damned dangerous.
yes, well given the patient's current condition, i am not sure that i see the downside.
maybe it's just her time.
then for once perhaps i am the beacon of hope around here.
it's alright.
everything's gonna be okay.
right here with you, sharon.
if you want to settle this, your people have to disengage.
no more civil disobedience, no more acts of violence.
i want our students back in school.
done.
i'm glad you called, madame secretary.
me too.
i'm afraid the tests are positive.
the mass is malignant.
what's happening?
move, move.
damn.
she's convulsing.
nurse, get me 10 ccs.
help me get her on her side.
nurse, nurse.
no, hold it.
i'll be damned.
madame president?
dr.
baltar?
it's so very good to see you.
no, no, don't--don't move.
don't move.
madame president, very good.
how's she doing, doctor?
i've never seen anything like it.
it'll be a while before she's a hundred percent, but her scans are clear.
cancer's gone.
are you sure? it's gone.
thank you. thank you. admiral.
you seem better.
much.
are you still holding the spokesman from the new faction in the brig?
yes.
would you take me to him, please?
certainly.
thank you. i'll wait for you to get dressed.
president roslin.
mr.
yahee, isn't it?
i thought it was time we met.
would you open the door, please?
do it.
all these people want is to be heard.
a member of your group nearly destroyed our tylium refinery.
before we can even begin to talk i need your personal assurance that there will be no more attacks.
as i told the admiral, i have had no direct contact-- genuine negotiations require trust.
do not lie to me.
i'll talk to my people.
make them understand.
excellent.
and i'll listen maybe even act.
but if you renege, i'll insist the admiral hunt you and your friends down, without mercy.
you seem very content.
sharon's child is safe.
adama and roslin have agreed that more study is required before any drastic measures are taken.
yes, but by saving roslin, you've denied yourself your rightful place of leadership.
there are many aspects of you, gaius, i will never understand.
you wouldn't.
neither, would i suspect, your corporeal counterpart.
do you love her? what is that? the letter roslin wrote me. to be opened upon the event of her death.
'president baltar.
i offer my sincere congratulations--' thank you. 'i say that knowing we've had our differences 'and that you take office despite my many reservations.
'you may be the most brilliant person i've ever met, 'but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion.
'you must be reminded of your ethical responsibilities 'and challenged to rise aboveyour own selfish needs.
'i don't write this to hurt you, 'but to beg you to open your heart.
'understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership, 'but for solace 'justice.
'find a way to give them that, 'and you will be a great leader.
'laura roslin.' after all i've done for the fleet.
after all i've done for her.
roslin's never trusted you.
she's undermined you at every turn, and now-- so now we know she's never gonna trust me.
this is not a political struggle anymore, gaius.
this is quite litterally life and death.
the president assured me that as long as there are no further acts of violence, she's willing to bring our concerns to the quorum and admiral adama.
she's trying to buy time.
she'll never be open to negotiating with the cylons.
i disagree.
i think we've made real progress today, and so does the vice president.
baltar?
yes.
just before i left, he asked to meet with me. he encouraged patience while he works with roslin from within.
and he offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity.
what's in it?
i don't know. he said that you should be the one to open it.
frack.
previously on battlestar galactica what about the ftl question?
it's possible.
it's labor intensive.
lotta grunt work but we should be able to upgrade the jump drives of the entire fleet with cylon technology.
not gonna be easy to sell the quorum on this one.
question has been called.
all in favor.
all opposed.
the vote is 11 to 1. motion carries.
no cylon will board a ship in this fleet without permission of its people.
ten of our ships refuse a direct order from the flagship.
another 12 won't even respond to our hails.
they're not doing anything illegal.
jump drive upgrades is a military decision.
and you alone get to make that determination?
yes, mr.
gaeta.
do you have a problem with that?
sir, tylium ship's pulling out of formation.
they're spinning up their ftl drives.
hitei kan has jumped away, sir.
taking all our fuel with them.
you think i know what a tylium ship is? i know that you do.
hitei kan, this is athena.
stand by to be boarded.
the world is frakked.
it's upside down and somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
are you that man? i'm one of them.
i need a partner.
you've got one.
every revolution begins with one small act.
somebody close that hatch.
let's talk.
it's fresh.
you want a cup? ever since they started grinding it out of algae i've lost the taste.
we got three more civilian captains pitching fits, refusing to allow the cylon engineers on board.
i thought we settled that a couple days ago.
well, the tylium ship didn't get the message.
they're screamin' bloody murder to anyone who'll listen, claiming they're being illegally seized by our marines.
i'm tired of this.
go to lee.
tell the quorum that if they don't get their ships in line, they can all share a blanket in zarek's cell.
i'll make the call, but mmm, smells good.
hello, colonel.
madam president.
how's it going?
you were saying, saul?
it's just, um given the fleet's mood toward cylons you might not want me taking point on this.
i'll be up there in a minute.
yeah.
mr.
vice president.
rumors are already starting to spread.
good luck kee the lid on.
believe me, the fleet's the least of my worries.
you're clear, sir.
and connor called in.
we're good to go with the small arms locker.
deck?
narcho and private paley.
they're all over it.
move out, corporal.
our biggest problem is still the quorum.
you can isolate them for a few hours, but they'll huff and puff, but reality will trump their sense of duty soon enough, with one exception.
we've been through this.
he's a wild card.
talkin' about the admiral's son.
well, push his buttons.
i hear you're good at that. the colonel's right, you know. the fleet has never been comfortable with this blanket cylon amnesty.
this coffee is terrible.
siccing lee on the quorum is only gonna be seen as a shot across the bow. he can hedge it all he wants, but the delegates will see it comes straight from you.
well, lee can handle it.
yes, he can, and so can you.
and i'm not getting involved.
so he can take care of himself and you can take care of yourself and i am not getting pulled back in.
yeah.
the legendary adama silence.
i can see right through it.
this passive-aggressive pretense that you are okay if i don't get involved.
i don't do passive-aggressive.
yes, you do.
you just don't know that's what it is.
well get some rest.
rest?
i'll try to make it home for supper.
i'll have it ready.
cantrell's the key.
tell lee.
if he can get to cantr i'm not son of a bitch!
i got a fuel leak over here!
frakkin' spark will blow the whole place.
hey, you guys.
i need all of you to clear the deck now.
now! sitrep, lieutenant.
raptor's transponder's down for the count, and lso's good to go, sir.
what the hell?
what are you doing? this ship's on hold for an emergency medical transport, not some bogus, v.i.p. shuttle.
oh, sorry, chief, i assumed the lso called it in.
this bird's been cleared for launch, asap.
no, i didn't get the order.
new mission takes priority.
the admiral believes that zarek may have an attempt on his life here on galactica.
given the vice president's controversial status, he's being transferred to colonial one.
all right.
soon as i confirm it with cic.
you have confirmation.
laird the admiral doesn't want this leaking out.
well, i'm sorry i can't take your word for it.
well, good riddance.
frakker's been up adama's ass since he transferred in from pegasus. he won't be the last.
get on that ship.
not yet.
damn it, i need you i know what you need.
i also know a little about revolution, mr.
gaeta.
success doesn't hinge on some grand operatic ideal or the will of the people.
it hangs in the cumulative moments, each one building on the next, and it could be lost with the slightest hesitation.
i started this, and i'll see it through.
now get on that frakkin' ship.
colonel tigh, sitrep.
cap is out.
dradis shows no enemy contacts.
fleet's still jacked up on zarek's anti-cylon bull.
lee's giving the quorum a shove, but it'd take a cavity search to find the backbone in that sorry bunch.
felix, i'm showing a launch, but we don't have anything listed in the flight log.
laird probably rescheduled and it didn't make it into the system.
see if you can find the update.
i've got nowart rounding up every marine that can still pull a trigger.
so if you get fed up playing chicken with these bastards, say the word.
hitei kan was a special case.
we have to shoot up every ship we go into, you can kiss this alliance goodbye.
nothing.
i better call down to the deck just to make sure.
yeah, hold up, hold up. is that your launch?
because i'm not seeing a squawk code. is there a problem?
we've got an unidentified contact off the flight deck.
no transponder i.d.
i'm thinking dradis ghost.
last thing i need.
four years without a pit stop.
equipment's sketchy as hell.
mr.
gaeta, order a full diagnostic on dradis.
yes, sir, right away.
order, order!
i remind you once again that mr.
zarek was taken into custody because he was agitating against a lawful order.
now, these cylon ftl drives are essential if the fleet is going to move on.
mr.
vice president.
don't look so surprised, lee.
even your father knows when he's holding a losing hand.
i'll take it.
yeah, i used to be pretty good at this game.
oh, yeah?
makin' the shot.
winnin' the big game.
can't believe that used to matter to me. that life back in the colonies it's like a dream to me now.
and the further away we get gods, i remember you and me back at joe's bar, slammin' drinks, shootin' pyramid.
those were good times.
they were, weren't they?
i really i really thought there was somethin' between us, you know? and when that didn't happen, i wondered, was it me?
no, diana, i was you know, now i'm thinkin' no.
maybe it was somethin' else.
some cylon thing.
your programming.
gods, i know it's been months, but i just can't let it go.
cool it!
save it!
we got him.
save it.
private jaffe.
log this.
yes, sir.
admiral, i'm getting a fire warning on deck near the main antenna array.
order the damage control team to deck.
have them report back to me with their assessment asap.
yes, sir.
admiral, if the wireless array goes down, we could lose communications across the fleet.
given our current situation, i'm thinking this fire might not be an accident.
zarek's true believers would have a field day if we went dark.
very well.
have the marine fire unit accompany the d.c.
party and prepare an evacuation of all personnel from deck.
yes, sir.
look at you, the proud papa.
when i named you hotdog, i sure as hell got that right.
knock it off.
aw, come on, don't be shy.
there had to have been other conquests for the great brendan constanza.
and you frakked half the fleet.
what do you have to show for it?
attention fire in compartment c. evacuate sections 29 through 42.
narcho.
you heard the alarm, captain.
evac the area.
i'm in charge here.
since when did they put pilots in charge of damage control?
hey, i'm talkin' take your frakki'' hands off me.
gods.
nobody even knows what you are anymore.
son of a bitch.
grab as much as you can carry and get up to the hangar deck.
you, take those four people on deck.
anybody asks any questions, you tell 'em it's routine, admiral's orders.
gaeta, cic.
this is starbuck, get me the admiral now.
he's busy, captain.
gods damn it, we've got civilians arming themselves down here!
gaeta!
gaeta, cic.
this is lee adama.
get my father on the line.
i'm sorry, lee, we're having a bit of an emergency right now. is it serious?
uh, nothing damage control can't handle, but you know the admiral.
yeah, well, i thought i did.
well, maybe you can help.
do you have any idea why tom zarek was released?
released, when?
oh, that's just perfect.
first he tells me to threaten the delegates with jail, then he blindsides me by giving zarek a pass.
doesn't make sense to me either.
as soon as your father gets back, i'll be sure that he knows you called.
problems on the home front?
i have to say, lee, you don't seem particularly happy to see me.
i'm glad you're out.
my father overreached when he had you arrested.
but i hope you changed your mind about the cylon ftls.
we need those drives.
at least the admiral thinks we do.
problem with you is that you're tryin' to have it both ways.
honor thy father or be true to your oath as the caprican representative.
at some point the two don't mix.
do you know why he released me? because i'm only a threat if he recognizes civilian authority.
afraid our experiment in democracy is about to end.
adama entertained it until now because of roslin.
but since she abdicated the throne no, he wouldn't do that.
really?
because he did it before.
tell me, what excuse did he give this time when he refused to take your call?
you're leaving.
for galactica, to prove you wrong.
sir, we just lost communications ship-wide.
switch to secondaries.
they're a no-go.
backups are down as well.
and the fire seems to be escalating.
i'm seeing cascading system failures across the board.
main antenna and backup both down at the same time?
with comms down, the damage control team has no way of relaying the status of the fire.
galactica, come in, galactica, come in.
galactica, do you read?
so you're tryin' to tell me that all communications are still out?
yeah.
what the hell's being done whatever this is about, you're making a big mistake.
oh, sure, we're confused.
maybe we should have a trial, sort it all out.
after four years of fighting with those cylon things, did you really think you could make a deal with them?
so where are your precious cylons now? take it from someone who died once, it's no fun.
let him go.
frak you.
i could do this all day.
who's next?
racetrack?
connor?
let him go.
all right, we need to get the hell outta here.
kara, now.
follow me.
please.
ah, gods! hang on, buddy.
hang on, you're gonna be all right.
frak! ow.
i know, it tastes kinda yucky.
i'll get more sugar next time in the galley, okay?
okay.
sharon, you better get her finished up and down to day care.
uh, helo?
helo?
i don't know, just grab hera in here!
go ahead, captain, grab for it!
okay, easy, easy, easy.
you want me, fine, just leave them out of it.
get her outta here, move!
hey! remember me, big man?
from pegasus? you and that toaster tyrol wasted my friend thorne.
yeah.
we didn't want that to happen.
you had a choice, but you backed the skin-job over your own kind.
and to prove how messed up it was, instead of showin' you the airlock, your cylon-loving admiral promoted you to cag.
frak you.
sorry.
i'm savin' myself for your sweet, toaster wife.
skulls?
racetrack?
gods, i flew with them.
semper frakkin' fi.
damn it.
way connor was talkin', they got people ready to move on every deck.
the hangar deck's just a beachhead.
they want the ship.
zarek played me just right.
must've made some new friends.
yeah, with a hell of a lot of firepower.
vipers, raptors, gun batteries.
you know we can't do this alone.
kara right now all we can count on is you and me.
take a breath, lee.
feels good bein' alive, doesn't it?
what the hell was that?
feelin' right for the first time in weeks.
okay, kara, my dad where is he? he was in cic when communications crapped out.
okay, cic's protected.
he won't give up without a fight.
the president?
don't know.
all right, come with me.
go.
what do they have down there, a forest fire?
where the frak are my damage reports?
admiral, sensors are still showing red, but these trace gas readings don't make any sense.
they're normal.
if something was burnin' down there the carbon monoxide levels would be spikin' through the roof.
if the fire's compromised our sensors it's possible all of our readings are suspect.
with communications out, we have no way of verifying anything.
all i know is i'm tired of being blind.
private jaffe.
double-time it down to deck.
check in with the damage control team, get their reports, and haul ass back.
yes, sir.
drop him.
hey.
see you real soon.
carl.
they're going to kill us.
sam? can you give me something to stop the bleeding?
yeah, all right.
don't you see? our children represent everything that the humans hate.
with resurrection gone, the thought that the cylon race could survive through natural procreation terrifies them.
enough.
you're scaring her.
right now they need us alive to use as bargaining chips against the rebel cylons.
especially you.
look, if you're expecting some grand wisdom, you can forget it.
i don't have any more answers than you do.
well, you might wanna keep that to yourself.
no, they're coming down.
we're headed toward 'em right now.
we can't hold 'em off.
come on, hurry!
out here!
we need more ammo!
admiral, i checked the array.
the equipment's been jury-rigged sergeant of the s, get your marines in here!
nobody gets in or out! what the hell are you doing?! what is this?! admiral!
hold your fire! cease fire! hold your fire! nobody fires without my order!
admiral!
get your staff to stand down.
you son of a bitch!
stand down, colonel!
everyone!
stand down!
you killed this boy.
admiral adama, i am removing you from command of this ship.
i am taking you into custody on the charge of treason.
you swore an oath when you put that uniform on.
you pledged to defend this ship and her crew.
you swore the same allegiance.
what happened to your oath? for seven years, i have done my frakking job and for what? to take orders from a cylon? to let machines network our ship?
no, you you are not the leader that you were when we started.
you're just a sad, old man that has let his heart and his affection for a cylon cloud his judgment.
i want you all to understand this! if you do this there will be no forgiveness.
no amnesty.
this boy died honoring his uniform.
you you'll die with nothing.
sergeant of the s, take the senior staff, put them in a holding cell, place admiral adama and colonel tigh under arrest.
do it!
sir don't touch me! please, sir.
take him.
this isn't right.
where are the s?
madam president, you all right?
i'm fine.
get inside.
there's been an uprising.
i'm not sure how many of the crew are involved.
it is widespread.
your father must know about this.
can't the marines stop it?
there should've been marines outside that hatchway.
madam president, we are in danger of losing this ship.
oh, my gods.
bill yeah, i don't know.
without comm we can't get through to cic. but it is bigger than galactica.
zarek's already back on colonial one.
he wants the presidency. of course.
frakking zarek. he always had dangerous ideas.
it's not too late to stop this.
address the fleet, call for calm.
the people will listen to you.
i'll do whatever it takes.
and i will not allow tom zarek to assume the presidency under any circumstances.
i have an idea about the wireless.
let's go.
sir, intercom's up.
i'm getting multiple reports of gunfire near the engine room.
order redwing to move in with his marines.
i want that area secured.
specialist gage stay with us.
stack a heavy pile right here.
stop them from gettin' in that door.
come on, people, faster's better.
they could show up at anytime.
let's go.
you understand i have no desire to leave you.
no desire at all.
but i have to go. if they're coming for anyone, they're coming for me.
and you'll all be safer.
no, it's our fault, gaius, because we can't protect you.
and i am so sorry for that.
all right, jeanne, okay.
your transport will be here soon.
i want you to take this.
and i want you to know that we will pray for you and for your safe return, okay? i'm deeply right.
uh, okay, okay.
uh, mr.
tyrol?
mr.
tyrol?
you are absolutely certain that it's imperative i leave?
look, i only know what jeanne saw. the hangar deck's gone.
cic and weapons are next.
and then nobody's safe.
hang on.
right, right.
so we should be getting out of here soon go.
and getting hold of some weapons, maybe?
because uh, jeanne, i don't want the statue.
you can keep the statue.
you keep the statue.
clear.
madam president no, it's all right.
they know who i am.
i need to speak to dr. baltar.
no, you're not welcome in here.
hey, i got this.
go ahead.
go on.
i need to see baltar.
there's somethin' you need to know.
i got people all over the ship givin' me information.
the admiral was just led away from the cic.
where to? no idea.
my guess would be the brig.
don't trust the ship's comm systems.
we're using these.
the hangar deck's lost to us.
if you can get your father to the secondary storage bay within the hour, i'll get him off the ship.
i'll handle the fleet.
go.
galen why are you doin' this? old man deserves a better fate than what he'll get from them.
go find your father, lee.
it's nowart, isn't it?
that's right, sir.
i thought i remembered you.
marine.
you put it on the line when we took new caprica.
got pretty hairy down there, sir.
hey, screw the war stories.
i remember you too, maldonado.
big mouth, not much of a soldier.
it doesn't matter.
because when this is over, there's gonna be a reckoning.
and live or die, it's how you act today that's gonna matter.
so what's it gonna be, nowart?
admiral, don't do this.
i'll be damned if i'm gonna let a guy like you run me off my own ship.
you wanna shoot?
go on.
let's see if you got a pair.
i don't want look, i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
put your hands behind your back.
you all right, saul?
i'll live.
what about him?
i think we'll take him with us.
go.
but obviously i have to get back as quickly going somewhere?
yes, matter of fact, i am.
they consider it to be a precautionary measure.
sensible given the delicate nature of the fleet.
very sensible, considering the fleet's tearing itself to pieces right now.
have you come to pray? no, i have something more tangible in mind.
there is a chance that we can avoid more bloodshed if i address the fleet and reassure them the cylons mean no harm.
well, your faith in your oratorical skills is impressive.
and i'd love to help, but unfortunately, communication down here, just as dodgy as i know you have a wireless.
you've been using it to communicate with you flock all these months.
it's a trick, gaius.
i wish it were.
she's afraid of your teachings.
she will take the wireless and she will silence you all right, okay, paulla thank you. she's got a point, hasn't she? i mean, if you can convince the fleet, why can't you convince her? the thing is that i never really believed in your conversion, so i was counting on your well-honed sense of self-preservation.
i'm so sick of your insinuations.
i recall your sudden allegiance to the priestess elosha and the scrolls of pythia the last time your political fortunes were in doubt.
tell me, how is that working out for you now? if it makes you happy, maybe we're both frauds and this is our last chance to atone.
civilians are trying to barricade the aft supply hold.
i'm on it.
gaeta wants us to back up redwing in the engine room.
they got four civvies down, but there's still some holdouts, so we're gonna need some more firepower.
where were you taking us? the brig.
gaeta wants all essential personnel and cylons held might see some friendly faces there.
get up.
sir, ships' captains are calling.
they wanna know why galactica's not responding to their hails.
put 'em up on speaker.
all of it.
and then get me a scrambled line to tom zarek.
we're unable to reach galactica.
admiral adama, do you read? are they going to jump away like last time?
who's in charge of galactica?
can't trust admiral adama. is any vessel in communication with colonial one?
i have colonial one.
mr.
zarek, i've taken command of galactica.
the admiral and his senior staff are in custody.
adama's still alive?
you sound disappointed.
it's a loose end.
i'm sure you have your reasons.
still, congratulations are in order.
with the future of the fleet at stake you've done a very courageous thing.
we can fine-tune our rationalizations later.
i'm still bringing communications back online.
and the fleet's in an uproar.
don't worry.
they'll fall in line.
especially after i shower them women and men of the fleet, this is your president.
what the frak?
we have come to a crossroads in our long and painful journey.
tom, are you hearing this? turn on your wireless. of all the decisions where's this coming from?
i don't know.
assuming the presidency, none was more frightening or more difficult than agreeing to this alliance with the cylons.
but we have come to a crossroads in our long and painful journey.
cylons and humans have been at war for generations.
we know nothing else. and we have been locked in a struggle that has seen both sides suffer unspeakable loss.
but with our supplies running low and our options limited, our former enemies may represent our last, perhaps our only hope. to those in the fleet and on galactica find that frequency, gage.
who would reject this alliance, i am asking you isolate the signal!
sir, i don't know how to.
gods damn it.
no, i am begging you to reconsider and place your trust back in those who have brought you this far, and to reject those traitors who would use your fear of the cylons to destroy colonial civilization president roslin, do you read?
galactica, do you read?
sir.
it's the vice president.
i couldn't get near the brig.
even if he is in there what's goin' on?
let's go.
it's all right, lee.
we're all right.
thank gods.
what the hell is this?
easy, he's our prisoner.
starbuck.
starbuck!
lower your weapon.
they've taken over the ship.
if you want it back, this is the only way.
we don't have time to take prisoners.
get out outta my face.
move!
starbuck!
they are not your men anymore.
they are the enemy!
felix gaeta.
who would've thought?
you probably knew him better than anyone back on new caprica.
well, obviously his loyalties were divided even back then.
seems we both made rather bad choices when it comes to our presidential aides-de-camp, wouldn't you say? how many men do you think gaeta has? enough.
hold up here.
middle of this mess, you really think tyrol's found a way off the ship?
i don't know, you tell me.
he's one of yours.
you got a problem?
yeah, i got a problem.
your people annihilated the human race.
no, let the great statesman talk.
you wanna know why tom zarek's got so much clout in this fleet?
because when you get past the arrogance, he's right.
we can pretend to put it behind us, exchange lofty words about an alliance, but if this is what survival has come to it's all we've got.
now, calm down.
it's all they left us.
secondary storage airlock this way.
let's go.
cic.
what?
it's baltar.
what do you want, gaius?
what do i want?
i want this to stopnow.
right now. this is madness.
this doesn't become, you know treason.
or whatever they're gonna call it when this thing is through.
i know you, felix.
i know you're a good man.
you're an honorable man.
you wanna do the right thing.
even your failings have been understandable.
what, like serving in your corrupt administration?
you know exactly what i'm talking about.
our little secret.
sealed with a very special pen.
but i forgive you for that, felix.
i'm telling you if you are hungry for redemption, this is not the way.
goodbye, gaius.
felix, please, listen to what's raptor six-one-niner's mission?
transporting human crew from the cylon baseship.
they should have called the lso by now.
they're not headed for the hangar deck.
we're ready.
it's good to see you, mr.
tyrol.
forgot this place was down here.
yeah, everybody did.
got trashed during the raid on new caprica, but i brought it back online for this.
oh, god.
i came here because i don't want you to worry about me.
and i know what you have to do.
this is section 12, copy.
go.
marine fire team just went past.
looks like they're comin' your way.
you got about two minutes.
mr.
tyrol, take them back the way we came.
you go with them, colonel.
come too far to walk out on you now, bill.
what are you doing, sir? colonel and i are gonna make sure that the president's raptor gets outta here safely.
initiating launch sequence.
open it.
admiral, madam president, please.
let's move it.
get it open.
prepare to launch.
raptor just took off from an aft airlock.
they're not responding to my hails.
gage, who's on cap? i got hotdog, narcho get me narcho on a wireless.
scramble frequency.
what are your orders?
arm all weapons.
engage the target and destroy.
you coulda gone over with her.
i couldn't have lived with it.
come on!
let's go! look out! it's been an honor to have served with you, my friend.
all right, soldier, give it to me.
cover up.
fire in the hole!
previously on battlestar galactica colonel fisk is the new pegasus commander.
the cylon's fetus contains no antigens.
it makes it universal donor.
are you saying you found a cure for the president's cancer yes.
i've got ships on half rations when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet target's ftl is history.
she's all yours.
he's all right.
repeat again, appollo is all right.
let's just be glad that we both came back alive, all right that's just it, kara.
i didn't want to make it back alive.
you're not going to shoot.
you're not like me.
hey, hey.
hey, don't go.
sorry.
i though you were still asleep.
you should have kicked me out of bed an hour ago.
if i hold up galactica's raptor, tigh'll have my ass.
which me both know currently belongs to me.
all right, let's move on to the the next item oh, no, gentlemen.
please, don't get up.
after the last few weeks, it just feels good to be on my feet, thank you though.
you've made a remarkable recovery, madame president.
remarkable, indeed.
but, now i'm playing catch-up, and i'm afraid during my illness i lost focus.
i let some things slide.
that's behind us now.
yes, it is.
to the point supplies are running low and the people are worried.
well, they wouldn't be civilians if they didn't have something to bitch about.
well, i think that in this case, they're entitled.
our inventory levels are tight, but they're not critical.
but all the way across the fleet, people are reporting shortages of essential goods and what they do get comes at a high price.
they're turning to the black market.
last week, one of my aides came down with pneumonia.
billy had to trade liquor to get the antibiotics.
it's the nature of the beast.
people want what they want.
a few trades would be one thing, commander fisk, that's reality.
but, i'm talking about criminals making outrageous demands on the people, so bottom line is, i'm implementing a new fleet-wide trade policy.
we need to be in control of our supply chain, not black market thugs.
i am ho that i can have the military's support on this.
admiral.
if you want pegasus to run these dogs down, you just give us the word.
our people will do whatever it takes to get this under control.
and it's good to have you back, madame president.
it's good to be back, thank you, admiral.
gentlemen, thank you. is madame president always so 'right in your face'?
her last-minute resurrection seems to have invigorated her somewhat.
yeah, well, maybe too much.
she doesn't really think her made-up plans and regulations to change anything, does she as if we don't have enough to do.
no, madame president sets a great prestige by her office and adama supports her, at least for the moment.
well then, so do i, just for the moment.
by the way, did you get the cigars i sent over i not only got them, i enjoyed them, as well.
oh, my pleasure, mr.
vice president.
well, i've got a ship to run.
look forward to our next visit.
as do i.
i got them from a friend.
paya.
hey, sweetie.
you seem to get an inch taller every time i see you.
what, i don't get my handshake well, it's okay paya.
i have a special surprise for you.
and it's in here.
you wanna come see what's he got - come on.
what have we got paya.
i've never been great with kids.
maybe next time i'll get one with, two eyes.
see if i can trade her for something else.
no, it's okay.
you just surprised her.
well, well.
look, i'm not sure when i'll be able to make it back.
i know.
i'm gonna have to ask for an extra hundred since you spent the night.
well, i wondered when you were going to show up.
season - episode 14 black market raptor one-two-niner.
you are cleared into the break.
galactica, raptor one-two-niner has the ball.
inbound speed two-two-zero.
admiral, colonel, i'm just getting started, but from the looks of him, i'd say he was garroted.
gods.
this is the last thing we needed.
admiral, you might want to take a look at this. looks like our friend, fisk, hit the jackpot.
cubit?
find anything else, let me know right away.
if i find anything else, i may retire early.
someone's sending us a message.
or running us in circles.
maybe there's another cylon in the fleet.
i almost prefer that to the alternative.
we start killing our own, all they have to do is sit back and watch.
fisk.
do we have any idea who did it?
no.
but we will do a full investigation and i want you to lead it.
don't you think it would be better if someone from pegasus dealt with this? even though cain's gone, her influence lingers.
i need someone i can trust.
you know, there were times when that was in short supply between us.
we've both been through an awful lot, son.
and i hope that we've grown stronger for it.
i need your help.
i'll call up a flight to pegasus right away.
anyone else been inside?
just the medical team, sir.
what?
do you know who i am? i am the vice president of the colonies, let me in.
captain adama.
commander fisk didn't tell me you were invited.
let him in.
they were going to let me in.
oh, my gods.
what's going on in here?
where's fisk? on a slab in galactica's morgue.
what, he's dead?
isn't this your brand?
careful, gaius.
you've bought yourself some good will by saving roslin.
but it's fading.
their old suspicions are re-emerging.
what are you doing here?
captain.
i was about to ask you the same thing.
wait a minute.
are you interrogating me? i'm not sure i appreciate your tone.
this isn't a diplomatic exercise.
a man was butchered.
his head was practically severed from his body with piano wire.
you're vice president of the fleet.
why are you acting like a child with your hand in the cookie jar, hmm? wonder what she would say if she saw you like this.
you know i can't believe it's even necessary for me to explain myself to you.
but obviously, no, i had nothing to do with commander fisk's death.
for the record, i just came here to discuss president roslin's new trade policy.
oh, i-i thought that was settled.
no, uh, commander fisk had some reservations.
i'll bet.
and as the vice president, i decided to assuage his doubts. of my own free will. is that sufficient? or would you like me to provide you with an alibi?
i'm sure i can rustle one up.
enjoy the cigars.
escort the vice president to his ship.
the wireless is going crazy.
word of fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
when we lose a command officer aboard a warship people are going to be concerned about their security.
crew can fall apart when their commander is killed.
pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
maybe, this time, they were lucky.
his personal log shows that he was rerouting supply runs, on- and off-loading freighters without command authorization. he raided the mcconnell, and at least a dozen other ships in the last week.
i also found a small warehouse of high value merchandise in his quarters.
he was working the black market.
well, half the fleet's working it.
fisk was getting greedy.
if he crossed one of his suppliers on a deal, that would explain the cubits that cottle found.
still doesn't tell us who did it.
well, he's going to need trading partners.
and they wouldn't be hard to find, even on galactica.
lee.
i'm scared.
paya's cough keeps getting worse.
i'll bring her something on my next trip.
which could be weeks if there's another cylon attack.
i keep hearing about shortages on the other ships.
people trading anything they can for food and for medicine.
really?
have you seen all the new working girls outside?
lee, when your baby's  because it's hungry, you'll do anything to make it stop.
come here.
mommy.
captain.
what do you want? is your wife around, colonel?
no.
why? is this hers?
oh, yeah.
she lost it a couple weeks ago.
where the hell did you find it?
on pegasus. in commander fisk's quarters.
she's burning up.
what did they say at the infirmary?
antibiotics have all been rationed out.
they said they might have something by the end of the week.
we got shortages across the fleet.
people begging for scraps.
somehow, you and mrs.
tigh have fresh fruit, real liquor-- all right, what the hell is this about?
you must have known she was trading with fisk.
or maybe i'll talk to her. she didn't give it to fisk, i did.
i traded it for a few necessities, a couple of things to help her get by, big frackin' deal.
there's nothing illegal about that.
not yet.
don't you play 'holier than thou' with me.
i haven't done anything that most people on this ship haven't done.
including you.
doesn't make us right, colonel, just a whole lot of people wrong.
you didn't make it to class today.
yeah, i've been pretty jammed up.
anyway, i'm not sure you need me holding your hand anymore. is that what you were doing?
holding my hand?
i meant it as a compliment.
permission to speak frankly, sir? you don't need my permission and you don't need the 'sir.' maybe that's the problem.
i don't really know what to think anymore.
so, i'll just ask. is this going somewhere?
dee please don't pretend like you don't know what i'm talking about.
you know our time together, our workouts.
something's changed between us.
i'm just not sure what you want me to say.
then don't say anything.
communications paging captain adama.
you have a priority ship-to-ship call, cloud nine.
captain adama here.
shevon.
shevon, it's me.
oh, my gods.
what did they do?
they said they knew about you and me.
they wanted to know what we'd been talking about.
i don't understand why they'd care.
all right, get what you need.
i'm taking you and paya back to galactica.
lee, wait.
it's the only place i can keep you safe.
what are you going to tell them about us? i'm not fooling myself.
i know what this is.
lee.
get away from us.
you listening?
i hear any more talk about fisk, i'm going send your whore back to you piece by piece.
and then i'm going start with the little girl.
i know who you are.
i know whose son you are.
and i don't care.
you tell adama to let it go. is that when you knew that you loved her? i thought so.
but you hurt her. this is captain adama.
i need a medic and a security team on deck, asap.
you wanted to see me, madame president?
yes.
thank you for coming, doctor.
have a seat.
would you like some tea? i'd love one.
you know, i'm never quite sure where we stand with each other, doctor.
why do you think that is? i can't imagine why.
i've never had anything but the utmost respect for you, and your office.
i understand that you and commander fisk planned to meet just prior to his death.
as i have already explained to captain adama, commander fisk had several lingering concerns about your new trade policy.
what can i say? and that's it?
gaius, she's afraid of you.
why-- are you asking me this? you saved my life.
and i'm grateful.
but i sense that there is some unease in you about assuming the presidency, and i'd like to offer you an out.
you what? resign.
return to your scientific work on galactica.
no one will question your motives.
you can consider it a second chance, like the one you gave me.
charming.
doctor.
this is a one-time offer.
i suggest you reconsider.
you know, madame president, i've never been particularly interested in politics.
i never wanted any lofty position of power.
i never wanted to be the vice-president.
that is, until this very moment.
because right now, i can't think of anything i want more.
one to the head.
you didn't do this i was attacked.
found him there when i woke up.
security bulletin said commander fisk was garroted with a wire.
whatever happened, looks like you found your guy.
what about shevon and her daughter cloud nine's an open port.
chances are, they're already off ship.
i'll get a team down here.
councilman zarek.
lee.
i just heard, are you all right what are you doing here - attending a quorum meeting.
nothing as exciting as all this.
i assure you.
i know these places are legal but still, the son of the almighty adama talk to me about the black market.
not much to say.
it's widespread, inevitable, and according to president roslin illegal.
so, it's no surprise that you and fisk were in it up to your necks.
fisk, maybe, but not me.
i represent astral queen.
i have to be careful about the company i keep.
this is fisk's log. he says, he made three runs to astral queen in the last ten days, and i doubt it was to discuss prison reform.
what do you want from me, captain names of ships.
contacts.
i can't help you.
why do you think fisk approached me to get a piece of your black market scam.
to offer you protection.
you and your father are so blinded by the past.
fisk's black market was up and running when he approached me. he knew adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttles, so he tried to force me into taking over the deliveries, creating a firewall between pegasus and the illegal shipments.
so, you're trying to tell me that you turned him down.
at great cost.
check the fleet logs.
see how many supply ships made stops at the astral queen after fisk's last trip.
the answer is none.
so, if fisk was trying to starve you out, why didn't you bring it to the quorum roslin's acting like the black market's some sort of aberration, but i thought you were smarter than that.
did you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashes i heard the security officer.
they gave you fisk's killer for a reason.
they're offering you a way out.
you know something, don't you just rumors.
there's a freighter, prometheus.
some people say it's gone off the grid.
but if you want something bad enough, that's where you go. the deals are brokered by an ex-military mercenary named phelan.
lee.
i hope she's worth it.
paya.
paya.
paya.
hey.
paya.
it's okay.
it's lee.
you remember, it's lee.
you're going to be fine.
i promise you.
okay, you just hang tight.
i'll be right back.
you may find this hard to believe, but my father was in the service too.
strict as hell.
probably the same as your old man but when the cylons attacked, all his duty and honor didn't add up to squat. is she dead i can see why you want her back, she's one of my best.
one of yours.
a good escort understands it's about a lot more than sex.
she knows when to listen and when to call for help.
lee, i had to.
don't blame her. the only reason you're alive is because i was able to see you through shevon's eyes.
and what i saw seemed reasonable.
like fisk.
fisk was a pig. he tried to force us to renegotiate.
so you killed him.
no.
i gave you the killer.
the murder weapon, the prints.
everything you needed to close the case legitimately.
despite the president's objections, the fleet needs us.
rationing's too tight, ship comes in too late, we're the pressure valve, we provide.
when shevon needed antibiotics, she knew where to go.
without us, people would have nowhere to turn. the fleet would tear itself apart.
and what about those children outside how are they hel the fleet everyone has needs.
some settle for cigars or liquor.
you wanted shevon.
others are more demanding.
it's hard to find the moral high ground when we're all standing in the mud.
i'm not not like my old man, captain, and you are not like yours.
i came alone.
but galactica tracked me on dradis.
all they'll need to vent this ship into space is an excuse.
so let's make a deal.
i want shevon, the girl.
i walk out of here, and you shut down this operation.
and all of you will live.
sorry, the little girl's been paid for.
no refunds.
oh, gods.
no.
wait.
lee don't.
come on, do it.
do it.
i made you a fair offer.
so did i.
yeah, you're probably right about everything.
you, me, fisk.
nobody can stop it, and maybe nobody should.
but it needs limits.
there's lines you can't cross.
and you've crossed them.
you're not gonna shoot.
you're not like me you're not gonna all right, it's done.
fleet relies on the black market.
much as we'd like, we can't wish that away.
so you're still in business.
for now.
but if they are any more killings, if you hold back essential medicines, if you ever touch a child shevon.
no, i don't want to see it's over, everything's gonna be okay.
lee, let go.
shevon, it's over.
i can't be what you want me to be.
i don't want you to be anything.
you want me to be her.
that's what this is about.
that's what this has always been about.
no.
that's not what this has ever been about.
come on, lee.
i know my job.
i'm a replacement.
for a lot of things.
things that men can't get anywhere else.
things they've lost.
she wanted to give you a child.
but you were afraid, so you pushed her away and then you ran. and you didn't stop running until it was too late.
well, i'm not her.
and paya is not, and will never be, your child.
commander fisk's murder has been resolved, and pegasus'crew appears to have accepted galactica's conclusions.
that's all, madame president.
not quite.
what about the ship, prometheus i understand it's the hub of the fleet's black market.
we will keep an eye on them.
keep an eye on 'em it's not exactly the solution i had in mind.
whether or not we allow a criminal enterprise to thrive in this fleet is not a matter of choice, captain.
admiral i've given lee full authority on this issue.
the decision is his.
i support your trade policies wholeheartedly madame president.
but we are never going to have a perfect system.
there will always be some kind of black market.
at least this way, i know names, i know faces, i know where they are, and we will monitor the situation.
thank you, gentlemen, i'm busy.
you should be sweating.
20.
why aren't you doing any of these - no talking, no cheating, all the way up, sneaky.
start again.
zero.
you lost track.
president wasn't very happy today.
no.
ever since you ejected from the blackbird, you've been different.
harder to reach.
i'm just trying to understand.
well, like you said, dad.
we've all been through a lot.
fair enough.
but you should have told me about the woman.
lords of kobol -.
previously on battlestar galactica the world is frakked.
it's upside down, and somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
are you that man? i'm one of them.
combat, gaeta.
we've got civilians arming themselves down here.
gaeta! sergeant of the s, get your marines in here.
nobody gets in or out.
what the hell are you doing?
admiral adama.
i am removing you from command of this ship.
admiral, don't do this.
i'm damned if i'm going to let a guy like you run me off my own ship.
the colonel and i are going to make sure that the president's raptor gets out of here safely.
no, dad, you can't stay here admiral.
i'm depending on you.
make sure these animals don't dishonor this ship.
i'll see you soon.
look out! watch out! fire in the hole!
raptor just took off from an aft air lock.
arm all weapons.
engage the target.
and destroy.
narcho, galactica, hostile raptor outbound.
bearing six, three, four, at two.
order your flight to engage the target and destroy.
roger, galactica.
well, well, well it's the brig rat.
admiral.
galactica, narcho, blind out of the sixth gate.
breaking, go in zone five to pursue.
red viper two, narcho, the target's in your front yard, hot dog.
engage.
narcho, hot dog, tally, i got her.
colonial raptor, red viper two.
identify yourself immediately.
repeat, identify.
hot dog, dig the crap out of your ears.
engage and destroy!
narcho, hot dog, target in range.
waiting for raptor i.d.
damn it, hot dog galactica, narcho, coming around.
bearing niner, three, four.
still no joy.
hot dog, narcho, destroy the target or disengage.
i repeat, destroy the target or disengage.
where's the where this is president laura roslin aboard the raptor, do not fire.
gage, jam her transmission.
escape from the mutineers that have taken over galac gage! grabbed it, sir.
they're still on us.
sit down, and hang on.
hot dog, narcho, target status report.
i don't know.
that was the president, she's on board the target.
we've got adama and tigh.
they were in the auxiliary air lock.
put tigh and adama down with the cylon prisoners.
belay that.
put tigh with the cylons.
bring adama up here now.
understood.
kareem, patch me through to red two.
lieutenant costanza, galactica actual, you were given an order, now follow it.
hot dog, stop frakking thinking and shoot, gods damn it.
galactica, narcho, tally, i have the target.
maneuvering in position.
frak, narcho!
i'm in, i'm in.
they've got a missile lock on us.
missiles missed the target.
the raptor boarded the base ship.
why are we under attack?
colonial vipers are  on our ship.
you're not under attack, they're  at us.
what did you do? their government has lost control.
our government has not lost control.
excuse me, how would you describe it, madam president?
adama is a fugitive.
gaeta has an army, and zarek has control of colonial one.
adama is free.
don't listen to him.
the last time we saw adama, he was cornered in an air lock with colonel tigh.
if you were forced to escape, gaeta and zarek must've had substantial support.
they don't! in fact, we're here because a pilot refused to shoot us down, tell him.
yes, but the other pilot had no qualms about shooting down the president of the colonies.
if they're willing to do that.
it's not safe.
we have to jump.
no.
i have to agree.
but what about the final four? tyrol, anders, tigh, they're still over there.
what about them? if you jump, you'll never see them again.
if you stay put, you give adama a chance to save them.
put your ship in the middle of the fleet.
use the fleet for cover.
give adama some time.
but what if no, gaeta won't jeopardize the fleet.
he doesn't have the guts.
come on, do it.
welcome back.
i had a feeling you wouldn't be on that raptor.
i care too much for this ship to let it be overrun by rats.
right.
if only you cared as much about the people on it.
you have no frakkin' idea.
well, then show me.
you want to save some lives?
get on the radio and call roslin.
tell her to come back and surrender.
no.
i'll ask you one more time, admiral.
admiral.
admiral.
you're the admiral now.
so you call up roslin.
make her laugh.
all hands to battle stations.
set condition one.
gun battery, stand by.
target bearing sir. the baseship.
they're moving into the fleet.
hmph.
they're hiding in the fleet.
battle stations, stand down.
marine launch, blue squadron have them quarantine the base ship.
gage, spin up our ftl.
alert the ship captains to do the same.
kelly, prepare for mr.
zarek's arrival.
now you're going to shoot me, mr.
gaeta.
shall we save the kit? and the attorney says, frakkin'.
and the priest says, do we have time?
you're gross.
damn it.
this is president laura roslin.
this is the president speaking, th the hello.
hello!
gods damn it.
it's okay, he's going to feel better.
wonder what gaeta's gonna do. in your case, cut off one of your frakkin' legs.
i have a net over the base ship, you know.
you didn't have to bring the whole quorum with you.
you're insisting on the trial.
i'm insisting.
that i want them where i can keep an eye on them.
look, i know you want to do the right thing.
oh, i'm sorry.
i was under the impression that you did too.
i do.
but we need to move on.
we can't move on.
until people have answered for what they've done.
which begins with adama.
one world at a time, tom.
i don't suppose anyone's gonna feed my dog. the admiral is charged with treason, desertion, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and gross dereliction of duty. the punishment for these crimes is death by  squad.
well, i'm not a very good shot.
the admiral is entitled to a court-martial.
we need a lawyer to handle his defense.
they need a pimp.
commander gaeta will represent the people.
commander gaeta why are you doing this? for justice.
justice, uh-huh.
so it'd be fair to assume that should i choose to pass on this field trip for justice, winkin' and blinkin' over there will use me instead for target practice?
just get on with your job.
fine.
bring in the judges.
i will be serving as judge.
i see, so we've run out of ship's captains, then.
captains are too busy protecting their vessels from the cylon baseship admiral adama welcomed into their fleet.
shove it up your ass.
i don't need a frakking lawyer.
you are charged with treason by who? desertion, with giving comfort and aid to this is a joke.
and you will answer for these crimes aid and comfort, oh, yeah.
i did bathe and wash them.
made their meals.
i love the enemy.
could i have have a few minutes with mr.
adama?
just to impress upon him the gravity of these charges?
please?
you want him to understand, i know you do.
make it quick.
this is the president.
this is laura ros hello?
hello?
hello?
we don't even have the protection of the fleet.
they've scattered.
and the viper patrols, they've gotten bolder.
some of them check their guns.
gods damn it.
into space is like they're inviting us to react.
i think we should all talk.
the world's upside down.
and someone has to turn it right side up again.
felix gaeta said that to me. he believes he's that someone.
i believe he's that someone.
but he has very big shoes to fill.
i brought you here because i wanted him to meet people who refuse to give up, people who have the courage to voice their dissent.
but at the end of the day, still stand by your president.
i think you should leave now.
mr.
vice president.
hear, hear.
shoot them.
go get mr.
gaeta.
i never agreed to this! yes, you did.
no, this is murder!
this is a coup.
that you began.
to take command and destroy our enemies, before they destroy us.
what've you done? this is what happens.
no no, it's a lie.
this is all based on lies.
don't you get it?
we we had the truth on our side, now now the truth is told by whoever is left standing.
adama has to go.
there's no turning back now.
sorry.
it was a difficult choice but we made our decision.
we're jum away.
we have a chance to survive.
i'm sorry, i would've thought as one of the final five, you'd have a broader vision than that.
if he hasn't done it already, gaeta will air lock tigh, tyrol, anders, then he'll start with the rest.
kara, helo, adama don't.
stop.
his fate has been all but decided, count on it.
please, don't.
ours isn't yet.
no.
no one believed that we would survive the cylon nuclear holocaust, or the hell on new caprica, or the 50,000 other crises we've lived through.
but we did, we're here.
we've made this veritable habit out of defying the odds particularly, william adama.
and he is alive.
he is alive.
and he will take command of this fleet again.
and when that day comes, he's gonna know who stuck with him and who ran. now who do you want to be? who do you want to be? hey, chief.
looking for a gun? hey, aaron.
sprung you, did they?
long live the revolution.
out.
just shoot me now.
i'm too frakking tired to get out.
you're a frakking machine, get out.
that's right, i'm a machine.
what does that make you?
dumbass?
this was a hell of a ship once.
huh, yeah, it really was.
heard your kid's not a cylon.
could have told you she was trouble.
thanks.
wouldn't have mattered.
go on, keep going.
go! go on, skinjob, go.
frak! forget it.
you think you can get me to cooperate, you'll get a pat on the back instead of a bullet.
don't let your pride get in the way.
put your innocence on record for the fleet.
your statement i won't do a statement.
gaeta and zarek are gonna fail.
you really believe that?
what do you think?
i won't betray my beliefs with a testimony.
you have people out there mobilizing, i saw them.
give them a chance to do something.
stall or play dumb we've been ready to proceed for some time.
are you injured?
i believe the word is damaged.
no frakking way.
it's never gonna work.
up close, i can take two of them before you take your shots.
from back here with a side arm?
we only got one chance to get this right.
and i'm gonna take it.
grenade!
never pulled the pin.
not funny.
yeah, it would have been if you'd thought of it.
no.
not funny.
tigh.
it's kara.
it's lee and kara.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
where is he?! bastards went to town on helo.
where is my father?
kelly took him.
what?
you were with him.
what happened?
i don't frakking know.
come on, damn it.
let's get out of here before they find us.
i have hera.
you okay? go left.
kara, frak that, let's go! got it, we'll catch up.
sam! oh, gods! okay oh, my oh, my gods!
look at me, look at me. look at me, do you hear me? okay, okay, okay.
kara! we can't stay here.
i'm here.
watch his neck, gods damn it.
kara, we got to go! we got to move sam.
take hera and go to baltar's people.
no one wants to go near those nutjobs.
okay, he's gonna bleed out.
don't move his head.
i can take care i can take care of myself.
saul! saul! you gotta help sam!
lee, go, get your father.
now go.
go! okay, get him to cottle.
athena, go.
okay, company, move out!
okay, let's move, let's move.
let's go, let's go.
okay, okay, baby.
okay, okay.
okay, okay, okay.
you deserted us on new caprica.
you let us twist in the wind.
i saved your frakking ass.
why can't you just admit that you've been derelict in your duties as an officer?
not only do you give aid and comfort to the enemy, you were about to grant them access objection, he's badgering the witness.
to jump drive to every ship in this fleet.
about to? i did it.
i gave them access.
and you know what?
i didn't give them aid and comfort.
they gave it to me.
we just got word that tigh and the skinjobs escaped.
don't worry, sir.
we're on it.
um, saul tigh was killed trying to escape.
i'm sorry.
but you did give aid and comfort to the enemy.
saul tigh was a cylon.
and even when you discovered that he was, you let him remain the xo, didn't you?
i'm not answering any more questions for you, mr.
gaeta.
the prisoner is guilty as charged.
this isn't the trial.
this is an asylum.
ah.
we're done here.
this is president laura roslin speaking from the cylon baseship.
felix gaeta has seized galactica by force.
the cylons were defending themselves.
they will not harm you.
i repeat, the cylons will not harm you.
jam that signal.
why, by the frak, is she still broadcasting?
where's hoshi?
get that little frak back into cic.
shut down your ftl drives it worked.
they couldn't jam it.
i thought this might do the trick.
show me your frakking hands.
you have to help me get him to cottle.
no, no.
no, just on the way here, me and my pen pal were shot at two times.
once by his own men.
sorry.
he's gonna die.
i'm sorry.
okay.
frak! ten ships shut down their ftl drives after roslin's transmission.
frakking roslin.
no, she did us a favor.
now we're clear who's with us and who's trouble.
gage, give the jump coordinates only to those ships that kept their ftls online.
order them to jump immediately.
yes, sir.
i need you to assemble an execution detail.
only men you can trust.
secure the main hangar deck launch tube.
take adama down there and wait for me.
can i count on you, noel?
all down the line, sir.
spying on me, tom? let's just get through this and move on, all right, felix?
where's the old man?
where's the old man?
their gonna shoot him.
where?
where?! main hangar deck launch tube.
come on, come on, let's go, gods damn it.
lee! i'm coming with you.
detail ready.
aim! fire! no! you were dreaming.
i couldn't wake you.
oh, god, they're gonna to shoot him.
shh.
i feel sick, i no. this is all wrong.
it's wrong.
please, stop, stop.
buti want to make you feel better.
then cut off my legs.
i ranagain.
i disappeared in the nick of time again.
fear makes people behave differently.
i didn't run out of fear.
not this time, anyway.
i ran away from those people.
god, those people.
i've got a kind of following on galactica.
like a fan club.
publicly, i heeded them.
privately, i scorned their provincial intellects.
their unfailing willingness to make me feel better.
i have to go back.
i have to go back, they're my responsibility.
i am sorry.
galactica this is president laura roslin.
release all those being held against their will, and return command of this fleet to admiral william adama.
surrender.
you have five minutes.
lieutenant allison.
carry out the execution.
yes, sir.
dad.
thank you, son.
they told me you were dead.
for a while, i was, bill.
i want to take back my ship.
lieutenant sorry, sir.
i've always respected you.
but i hate the cylons.
and i can't take orders from a leader who won't fight them.
colonel.
stand down.
tie him up.
put me on speaker.
this is tom zarek.
president of the twelve colonies.
it's over, laura.
saul tigh was killed attempting to escape.
bill adama was tried and found guilty of his crimes.
squad executed him this morning.
it's done, laura.
you need to think about the people of this fleet now and surrender.
no.
not now, not ever.
do you hear me? i will use every cannon, every bomb, every bullet, every weapon i have down to my own eye teeth to end you.
i swear it!
i'm coming for all of you! so now we have a military leader and a president all-in-one.
and how would you have answered her? if you would have been here.
baseship's arming itself, sir.
are we jump ready?
affirmative.
set the rendezvous jump coordinates.
set your board to green.
there's been enough killing.
i'm leaving them behind.
unless you object.
oh, yeah.
galactica, this is president laura roslin.
surrender.
gods damn it.
sir, board is green.
counting it down.
jump in ten nine eight ow! six five four three ftl just went offline.
get a crew.
get someone down to the engine room, right now.
come on, move it!
gaeta gaeta, launch your birds.
gaeta, wake up.
what the frak are you doing?
launch your birds!
gaeta, gaeta, we have to defend, do you understand that?
do you understand? gaeta, we need to defend! one day soon, there's gonna be a reckoning.
gun batteries have fixed target bearing.
standing by to fire.
gaeta, what the frak is wrong with you? wake up! weapons hold!
give me a weapon.
put your weapons down.
drop your weapons!
connect me with the president.
right away, admiral.
madam president.
this is the admiral.
stand down.
i repeat, galactica's secured.
stand down.
bill.
oh, no.
suppose a long time ago, it was architecture.
there was a year there where i scribbled floor plans on everything.
dining room table, patio tiles, rare books drove my parents crazy.
how old were you?
i don't know, uh, eight, maybe, nine.
i tell you one thing, though, i had some pretty frakking amazing ideas.
restaurants shaped like food.
and top-heavy buildings, and stairways, every everything had to have a stairway.
spoils of war.
when i was older, uh, then it became medicine, and, uh, engineering, photography.
i think i would've made a better architect than any of those, though.
and then, i discovered science.
and i i thought i was really, really good at it.
until i met you.
felix don't.
and please, no religion.
i'm fine with how things have worked out.
really, gaius, i am.
i i just hope i hope that people realize eventually who i am.
i know who you are, felix.
i know who you are.
ready.
aim. it stopped.
fire.
i could use a drink.
you've always been there for me when i need you.
you just go to sleep.
i'm sleepy.
i'm so exhausted.
i'd do it all again.
oh, no! will you help me up, please?
it's okay.
you can do that much.
thank you. you're very kind.
among bright stars, i'm lost.
you're not lost.
i'm right here.
there's a new tide.
and all the forgotten faces, all the forgotten children we seek the great forgotten language.
it's gonna be okay.
we made it through the mutiny.
not yet, he hasn't.
he's got a bullet in his brain.
then take out the bullet.
the colony never forgets.
see that pale spot over there?
that's a massive hematoma pressing on his brain.
we gotta drill holes in his skull and drain it.
then when the swelling goes down, i'll bring the brain guy over from inchon velle and we get a look and see how we can get at that bullet.
the mind is its own place.
then get the brain guy.
get the frakkin' brain guy.
we don't need a specialist yet, starbuck.
i can drill.
and a hell of heaven.
i'm right here, sam. he whose guile stirred with revenge, i'm right here, sam.
i'm not gonna go anywhere.
give it a rest, starbuck.
deceived the mother of mankind he's talking, but he can't hear you.
just shut up and drill.
and all the forgotten faces we seek he's in pain.
no, that's just a reflex.
we'd been to that beach too.
yes, we'd been to that beach.
sometimes ellen would be there too.
because she loved the water.
she loved the water.
hello, john.
i don't care for that name.
i think you know that.
i named you after my father.
and you made me in his image.
thanks a million for that.
i'd love a drink, john.
if it's not too much trouble.
i take it you're here because things didn't go very well down on new caprica with you and the mister?
i betrayed the resistance, and he poisoned me.
nothing like true love. he did what he thought was right.
that's all any man can do.
he's not a man.
as someone with first-hand knowledge, i beg to differ.
he's a machine.
so are you.
i think that depends on how you define things.
your ancestors didn't crawl up out of the swamp.
personally, i'm rather proud of that.
you really haven't changed at all, have you? on the contrary, i've made vast improvements.
you'd be astonished.
and yet, you're still the same confused and petulant little boy i loved so dearly all those years ago.
it's sad.
i had such high hopes for you.
and i for you.
unfortunately, it appears you still stick to delusional thinking instead of accepting the reality of your life for what it is.
humans have a word for that, ellen.
schizophrenia.
you used my name, john.
that's good.
there's hope for you yet.
we'll talk later.
john?
it's a bit cold in here.
i'll get you some clothes.
after all, i've seen it all before.
the mutiny did enough damage.
now what, chief?
i first noticed it when i pulled the sync coil.
you're gonna need to get your people to go all the way down to the hull to see how far down it goes.
do it.
excuse me? i know it's not your job.
thing is, is i need a chief.
and all i have is a is a galen.
that you do, sir.
see, you still call me sir.
i think we have to accept what we are.
will you accept the title, chief?
i'm still a cylon.
is that right?
so's my xo.
fix my ship, chief.
yes, sir, admiral.
kara.
hey.
i've seen everything.
sam, i'm sorry.
no i'm so sorry.
no.
i never should have taken you out of that jail cell.
i should have killed that frakker when we had the chance.
no.
shh.
it's okay.
it's okay.
no, it's okay.
it's about as far from okay as it could possibly be.
you wanna blame someone?
blame me.
no, no, it's all right.
kara, listen to me. a wonderful thing has happened.
you have to get the others.
what others?
galen and tory and saul and ellen.
please.
ellen's dead, sam. of course. of course.
i know.
there's too many layers.
just get the rest of them.
please tell them i remember everything.
earth.
why we're here.
everything.
i've seen everything.
battlestar galactica s04e15: no exit edited and synced by rogard you know, i've often wondered what changes the mortal experience would have on you.
i never seriously considered the answer would be virtually none.
do you still suffer from night sweats and scary dreams of dog-faced boys chasing you through the yellow mists?
sleep that's a good example of a supremely unproductive human attribute that for some reason you chose to write into our software.
fortunately, i was able to delete that particular subroutine.
and i stopped slee about 20 years ago.
fine.
if you really think we poisoned you and your siblings with human traits like sleep, and centurion values like belief in a living god, why then did you spend all these years in single-minded pursuit of such human ideas as vengeance and murder?
why not just choose to explore this notion of being the best machines the universe has ever known?
because justice pulls me back.
my forebears on the centurion side of the family were the slaves of humanity.
and i want justice for that.
doesn't have to be this way, john.
oh, lunch has arrived.
here, dear.
put it here.
i believe you've met this eight.
you knew her as sharon valerii.
boomer.
i can't tell you how good it is to see another person i know.
i'm assuming there's a whole ship full of my children out beyond the s.
there's no need to be shy.
tell her how it feels to be in the resplendent presence of one of the fabulous final five.
he's taking a risk, exposing you to me.
it's not easy winning his trust.
how'd you do it?
we achieved a certain rapport.
really?
you're full of surprises today, john.
that's his real name, by the way.
no, it's not.
i hate it.
tell me more about this rapport you have with john.
he's teaching me to be a better machine.
to let go of my human constructs.
what about the swirl?
has he taught you that yet?
if you'll excuse me, i have some people to kill.
why, john, i think you're blushing.
no, it's just the faulty blood pressure in this miserable body you designed for me.
no, no, no.
you should stay.
stay and have a heart-to-heart with your creator here.
you can ask her why she made you the way you are.
self-destructive, hyper-emotional, torn apart by conflicting impulses.
tell her how extraordinarily happy this makes you.
you know why he brought you in here?
he likes an audience.
someone to nod when he talks about justice.
watch, boomer.
make up your own mind.
we all worked in the same research facility.
you and ellen, you were married then too.
you two lived together.
what, like roommates?
no, you were madly in love.
you were planning on getting married.
when the nukes hit, i pulled ellen out of the rubble.
she said we'd be reborn.
does that mean we downloaded somewhere?
yeah, on a ship that we placed in orbit around the planet.
so we knew the end was coming.
we'd been warned, yeah.
we downloaded.
yeah.
but the cylons on earth could have children.
so why did we even have that technology?
probably invented resurrection.
okay, you're cold as ice.
i'm fine.
you still have a bullet in your head.
you wanna take a break?
kara, i have so much more to tell them.
we didn't invent resurrection, okay?
we reinvented it.
organic memory transfer came from kobol, along with the 13th tribe.
it fell out of use after our people started to procreate.
we worked night and day to rebuild it.
galen, your work was amazing.
but it was ellen it was ellen who made the intuitive leap that brought the system back online-- all right, i said you could have five minutes.
it's been over a half an hour.
sam:i'm fine.
good gods, man.
you're soaked in sweat. he said he was okay.
ishay, get your ass in here.
where were we going?
what was the plan?
look, colonel, you may be the xo, but in sick bay, i call the shots.
now everybody, out, right now.
out, out, out.
go.
please, please.
he said he was okay.
oh, gods.
gods, so much killing.
look at this picture of jacob.
this is just a terrible picture.
he'd hate it.
i'm trying i'm trying to find another one because everyone will see it up on that wall.
you sure you want to be here?
yes, i definitely want to be here.
it's such a senseless, horrible way to die.
these people only wanted to try and keep us civilized.
sometimes i hated them, but i knew every one of them, and now i wonder who we are without them.
well, actually, i've been thinking.
we need a new quorum or something else.
these these old planets, that's not who we are anymore.
we're a fleet now, and our daily lives are defined by the ship we're on.
we're not capricans anymore.
we're from galactica.
we're from colonial one.
maybe we should acknowledge that.
i think that that's a very excellent observation, lee, and i think that you should keep it in mind when you are assembling new representatives.
when i assemble the new representatives?
i will, of course, remain by title as president, but- madam president, you can do a lot more than that.
no, i can't, lee.
it's time i let someone else do the heavy lifting.
i don't know what to say.
i would be honored if you think i'm the right one.
you are the right one, lee.
you have always been the right one.
my only concern about you is that you're so hell-bent on doing the right thing that you sometimes don't do the smart thing.
well, then, um i'll try and be smarter.
and wronger.
i gotta warn ya. it looks bad.
frak me.
how many are like this? there's about a dozen bad spots, the length of the ship.
if they go, this thing'll slam shut like a book.
how'd it get this bad?
galactica was 50 years old when the war started.
put her through some things that would crush lesser ships.
slammed her down on the atmosphere.
most ships aren't built to spec.
there's lots of places where the skin's too thin.
and the bolts are just too small.
you're frakkin' telling me they cut corners?
yeah, they did.
but these big cracks, it's a good, clean break.
i can fix that, you just- just don't jump her for a while.
i can squeeze some more life out of her.
okay.
but the crew i want it all human, all right?
yes, sir.
so why did we go to the 12 colonies?
we needed to find the other tribes and warn them.
we knew they would continue to create artificial life.
we needed to tell them to-- treat them well, keep 'em close.
but by the time we got to the colonies, they were already at war with the centurions.
it happened again.
but the holocaust on earth took place thousands of years before that.
how is that possible?
we hadn't developed jump drives.
we traveled at relativistic but subluminal speed.
time slowed down for us, but thousands of years had passed-- hey, hey, hey.
just give me a second.
cottle said to stop-- kara, i'm fine.
i have to do this.
you remember the demetrius.
you know what it is when you have something that you have to do.
i used to.
kara, if i had the answers for you all the answers about why you came back, what you're supposed to do, you would want me to tell you, right?
do you?
kara, no.
i-- but so much is coming back.
maybe.
i just please.
let me keep going.
the centurions were already trying to make flesh bodies.
they had created the hybrids, but nothing that lived on its own, so we made them a deal: you stop the war, and we'll help you.
we developed the eight humanoid models, and we gave them resurrection.
eight?
you said eight.
we're missing someone.
oh, wow oh, everybody's glowing.
sam! sam! get doc cottle!
get him.
get doc cottle!
doc cottle!
sam! get cottle!
oh, i always did love a good slideshow.
vacation snaps?
you know what it is.
the temple of hopes, built by the 13th tribe they stopped and prayed for guidance during their exodus, and then god showed them the way to earth.
and now it's a monument to your vanity.
the temple of the five.
nice touch, the exploding star.
when the star went nova, one of your children saw your faces.
one of the threes, the one who called herself d'anna.
so i just boxed her entire line.
boxing isn't permanent.
not like number seven.
you can undo it.
it's not likely.
by planting that carnival trick to reveal your own faces, you left me no choice.
we didn't plant anything.
we backtracked the path of our ancestors, found their temple.
the one true god must have orchestrated these events.
john? in all your travels, have you ever seen a star supernova?
no.
no.
well, i have.
i saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the universe.
other stars, other planets, and eventually, other life.
a supernova.
creation itself.
i was there.
i wanted to see it, and be part of the moment.
and you know how i perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe?
with these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull.
with eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the em spectrum.
with ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.
the five of us designed you to be as human as possible.
i don't want to be human!
i want to see gamma rays.
i want to hear x-rays, and i want to i want to smell dark matter.
do you see the absurdity of what i am? i can't even express these things properly because i have to i have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language.
but i know i want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws and feel the solar wind of a supernova flowing over me.
i'm a machine.
and i could know much more.
i could experience so much more, but i'm trapped in this absurd body.
and why? because my five creators thought that god wanted it that way.
you have something to say? don't you feel the slightest bit of remorse for what you did to him?
what you did to us? no. because he's wrong, boomer.
there's no need for remorse or blame.
we didn't limit you.
we gave you something wonderful.
free will.
the ability to think creatively, to reach out to others with compassion.
to love.
love?
who? humans?
why would i want to do that?
who would i want to love? what, are they still in there?
we're running out of time.
we gotta talk to him.
you heard what he said, right?
the centurions couldn't build skin jobs, so we showed them how, then gave them resurrection.
it all traces back to us.
no, no, no, he said that we ended the first cylon war.
we bought time for humanity, right? the old man said the humans had to own up to what they made.
but we made the skin jobs.
it's all about what we made.
the destruction of the colonies.
but the humans on kobol made us.
go back far enough, it's always them.
yeah, you point a finger back far enough and some germ gets blamed for splitting in two.
no! maybe we share the guilt with the humans, but we don't get to just shove it off onto them.
what are they doing in there?
some picture of his brain.
some kind of scan of something.
no, it's true. in a way, the seizure was actually a good thing.
it let me get in there and take this new picture.
look what i found.
that's your your bullet.
you see how it's lodged there in the vascular ring.
that's where all of the major arteries converge.
the vascular ring, that's what binds the thoughts in tight sheaves in the field you need that.
sam.
i'm good.
i'm here.
i'm good.
okay, what's what's really fascinating is how it's eroded this blood vessel here.
and in fact, it leaked.
it was just the tiniest squirt of blood that caused your entire seizure.
it's remarkable, really. of course, if it happens again, we're talking major hemorrhage.
i mean, death within minutes.
so take out the frakkin' bullet.
yes.
and we need to repair that blood vessel.
luckily, the swelling's gone down, so i think we actually have a shot at this thing.
whoa, hold on.
these memories that i've been recovering, is there any chance i'll lose them?
any time you go digging around in the brain, there's always the possibility of ancillary damage.
no, no, no, then we need to hold off until i-- that circle start and n-n-n the words are okay, something's obviously wrong with him.
what is it?
it's aphasia.
it's affected his language center.
we call it word salad.
it's not unusual.
starbuck, this boy has a bullet that needs to come out, and he's asking us to wait.
if i kick this decision over to you as the wife, what would you do? wait, whywhat?
no, that's not-- the first opening that's not that's not the random motor that's frak it.
godsdamn it.
kara, i'm okay.
i'm fine.
okay?
i'm okay.
please, don't take this away from me.
i need more time, okay? prep for surgery.
kara, please.
please.
let's get it done i need more time.
so much is coming back to me.
just a little more time.
you have until they knock you out.
okay.
that's all i've got.
that's until they knock me out, and then as long asas-- you have the words, sam.
if i can just complete the circle, i can get the words.
he has a remarkably clear image.
well, that's a nice wakeup call.
something's happened.
they've destroyed the resurrection hub.
begun contemplating your mortality?
more than that.
our extinction.
always so dramatic.
it's true, ellen.
we can't procreate biologically, so we're going to have to find a way to rebuild resurrection.
well, good luck with that.
don't need luck.
we need your help.
they destroyed the hub, but they don't even know about the colony.
all your equipment is still there.
i only know part of the system, john. it would take all five of us to rebuild it, and even then, i'm not sure-- you're lying.
no, i'm not, john.
don't insult my intelligence.
your children are dying, ellen.
and you won't lift a finger to save us? why? out of spite?
because i refuse to kneel to your orthodoxy?
now you finally see the truth about your final five.
just tell us.
tell us about resurrection.
i can't.
it would take all of us.
you see how she forces me? they're no better than the humans that enslaved us.
if you don't tell me how to rebuild resurrection, i'm gonna cut open your head john.
and look for it there.
the brain is a marvelous thing.
it's a big electrical grid.
just lay it open, stimulate it in the right places, and i can trigger your deepest memory.
your deepest fears.
your deepest guilt.
and even the recipe for life everlasting.
so cavil was the first one we made?
john.
we treasured him.
he helped us build the others.
so we didn't think this was a bad idea?
building cylons after we had already seen the cycle? the centurions had a single loving god.
ellen said it changed everything.
if the cylons embraced love and mercy, then the cycle of violence could end.
single god? like a one, true god? yeah.
and that came from the centurions?
yeah.
cavil rejected mercy. he had a twisted idea of morality.
so he turned on the five of us. he trapped us in a a thing.
a the pocket.
it's a compartment.
and then he took the o2 offline. he suffocated us. he killed us.
yeah.
so when we downloaded into new bodies he blocked our access to our books no uh, our memories and implanted us with false ones.
yes.
set us up like a boomer.
memories that we thought were real.
i guess he boxed us for a while.
introduced saul first, not long after the war.
and then the gazelle.
the the ellen.
and back on earth, the warning signs that we got, they looked different to each one of us.
i saw a woman.
tory, you saw a man.
funny.
no one no one else could see them.
galen, you thought-- that's it, it's time to go.
cottle?
no.
listen to me. the seven.
tell me, please.
yes, sevenseven seven was the daniel.
you sure about the word?
yes. he died.
daniel died. he was seven.
okay, take him.
i'm sure. it was daniel.
i'm sure.
no, we need to finish.
let him go now.
saul, listen to me.
saul, stay with the fleet.
it's all starting to happen.
it's the miracle.
right here.
it's a gift from the angels.
stay with the fleet!
kara, make 'em stop!
i stood up for you on demetrius!
you owe me! kara! saul?
how'd it go?
oh, you're awake.
where's the booze?
we haven't had any around for weeks.
remember?
the smell of it was making me sick.
was that weeks?
i'm glad you're back.
what did he have to say? cottle kicked us out. he never got to finish.
i'm sorry.
something new started.
he's been moving like he just came alive tonight.
just tonight, huh? i don't feel anything.
wait.
he'll do it again.
you know, we should, uh, get, like, a crib and all the stuff that a baby needs-- huh. he moved.
i felt it this time.
i did.
i felt my son move.
giggles he wants to come out and play.
that's a little dated, isn't it?
he needs a patch over his right eye.
i prefer to remember saul before you did that to him.
sentimental till the end.
the simons are prep the o.r.
i think you'll be impressed with the progress we've made in memory recovery.
it might take a while.
i'm sure you'll make the procedure as long and painful as possible.
you're mistaken if you think i enjoy this.
oh, come on, john. of course you do.
you're a sadist.
why not just kill us and be done with it?
why send us to live among the humans?
i wanted you to see what they're like up close and personal.
so i gave you all grandstand seats to a holocaust.
but we didn't die.
and then you decided that we hadn't suffered enough.
so you picked me up, put me on a transport, took galen's confession, played resistance fighter with sam, tortured saul, but didn't kill him.
you had a dozen chances.
but you wanted to wait so that when it finally happened, when we'd download back, we'd be ready to admit we were wrong and pat you on the head for giving us the right amount of suffering, the right amount of punishment, all weighed out.
then we could give you the approval that you've always craved.
you see, you claim to be a perfect machine, but you are driven by the most petty of human emotions.
jealousy and rage.
i know what you did to daniel.
that seven didn't thrive.
sad.
and it's too bad we're not made out of something more sturdy.
metal.
that might be nice.
daniel was an artist.
and so sensitive to the world.
i was very close to him.
but john decided i was playing favorites.
maybe i was.
someone contaminated the amniotic fluid in which we were maturing all the daniel copies.
and then corrupted the genetic formula.
i knew it was john.
envious.
sadistic.
and who made me? that's what we're dancing around here, isn't it?
if i'm so irredeemable, if i'm such a mistake, if i'm so broken, then whose fault is that?
it's my maker's fault.
and that's not god, that's you.
this is on you.
no, no, john.
god, no, you you have done terrible things.
but you are not a mistake.
if you could just accept yourself as what you are, as the boy i made, you can be good.
you can be anything.
i love you, john, because i made you.
it's okay.
it's okay, john.
it's o-- don't you dare! i've gotta scrub for surgery.
i can't wait to see what perfection looks like on the inside.
no, no, down there.
yeah.
across the beams.
across, not lengthways.
run a support there.
i know what patching looks like, chief.
this isn't about those cracks, admiral.
i started thinking about damage that you can't see.
you know, stuff that's deeper in.
that you normally see on an x-ray.
dealino, fire it up.
okay, chief.
it's online.
we prepped the beam with this liquid that fluoresces.
it's not an x-ray, but you get the idea.
it's throughout the entire ship.
hairline fractures in all the beams.
it's in her bones, admiral.
her bones are rotten.
ahh.
i have an idea.
there's something on the base ship that can help.
cylon technology?
it's this organic resin.
it'll grow into the metal.
make it stronger.
it'll take the load as it matures.
as it matures?
it's biological.
out of the question, chief.
all due respect, admiral.
you asked me to do this job.
what's your life worth to you? no.
i'm sorry.
i'm so very sorry.
i was greedy.
i kept you too long.
i thought maybe i was the seven.
i need to be something.
i'll be here as soon as you wake up.
and i'll give you all the time that you want.
we'll learn all the secrets, okay?
okay, okay, okay, here we go.
how i can figure it out all right, kara, time for you to leave.
here we go.
thank you. yup, yup, yup.
let's go.
retractor.
thank you. how do you stand it?
knowing that he hates you for the things you've done?
maybe he doesn't.
love's like that sometimes.
the simons are ready for the surgery.
they'd like you to put this on.
a prop to legitimize john's final bit of theatre.
no, thank you. you should have brought a tumbrel.
never mind.
let's get this over with.
still in there?
doc said, like, two hours.
been in there a lot longer than that.
we only needed a little more.
i want to ask him about that frakking song.
ask him when he gets out.
starbuck, i got something for ya.
there's your bullet.
doc plucked it outta there and repaired the artery.
he's gonna live.
when's he gonna wake up? i'm actually surprised that he's not awake by now.
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
his brain is repairing itself.
we're hooking up an eeg and gonna take a look and see what's going on.
go ahead.
boomer, have you really thought about this? i have.
you're gonna regret your part in this.
i'm sure i will.
what are you doing?
forgiving you.
hey, sam.
you're gonna be okay.
you got a room full of rabid cylon-types that can't wait to hear the next chapter of their life story.
i think they're ho for a musical.
so you better hurry up and get better.
they're starting to look a little mean.
don't bother.
excuse me? there's almost no brain activity.
he doesn't hear you.
he's not in there.
give me the chief.
this is the chief.
chief do whatever you have to do to save our girl.
yes, sir.
edited and synced by rogard.
previously on battlestar galactica hi, um we're-we're kinda lost again.
we're trying to get to the cic.
could you- alking, no talking, please.
no cheating.
hold it up a little higher.
eight.
sneaky.
nine.
uh start again.
you lost track.
zero.
i've asked you here to find out why the cylons hate us so much.
it's what you said at the ceremony.
that humanity was a flawed creation.
and that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed.
hmyosaid that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive.
maybe you don't.
sleeper agents within the fleet.
takeover by brute force cylon impregnation and reproduction multiple models suicide bombings assault on natural resources.
eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known cylon models moving in and out of galactica's brig.
admiral adama has made no comment on this situation.
we will continue to- how the hell did this get out to the press?
i'm surpri it didn't happen sooner.
told you've been meeting with her regularly, allowing her to interact with members of your crew.
she's a military asset, providing us with vital strategic intelligence.
while we pray that she's not somehow colluding with other cylons.
if i felt for one second that she posed some kind of a threat to this fleet, i'd pull the trigger on her myself.
i think the fleet may need to hear that, admiral.
even more, they need ve it.
someone took theto vitamins this morning.
yeah, i don't know what got into me.
no, you're right.
kee sharon valerii alive, allowing her pregnancy to continue- there is no road map for any of this.
somebody, somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions.
i agree.
i wanna stay ahead of this.
acknowledge the cylons' existence, and then make some kind of case for her to stay aboard galactica.
i don't think that's gonna work.
what?
why? i think you need to trust the people.
use the press, tell them the truth.
i mean, we barely know anything about the cylons.
and until we learn more, we're not gonna destroy the only source of information that we have, period.
period.
that simple, huh? uh well um, could i- could i have a minute?
sure.
important?
mm-hmm.
you were saying about the hard questions i know it's just my debate team ring, but it's the best i could do.
this this really isn't how i planned it.
anyway, um billy i love you.
i've loved you since- since the first day i met you.
i mean, you were half naked, granted i know that i kind of blindsided you with this.
okay?
i mean, it doesn't have to be tomorrow.
we can take our time.
billy, i can't marry you.
i don't know how else to say it.
i'm sorry. he pulled out that ring and it was like an electric shock.
i could barely say anything.
well, maybe you're regretting that you didn't say yes.
no.
i don't know what to make of me and billy, but i know i can't marry him.
then again, i don't know what to make of you and me either.
'scuse me.
hey, two more.
coming right up.
ellen.
it's, uh it's good to see you.
it's good to see you, captain.
dee.
billy.
i didn't know you were coming down here.
i, um i grabbed a two-day rotation.
i thought i'd grab some & r. i'm on business, as usual.
captain adama.
oh i really am an idiot, aren't i? no, billy- don't.
don't bother.
can you give us a minute?
no, you know what? have a seat, captain.
be my guest.
billy, i'm sorry.
i thought if anything, we were honest with each other.
but you knew you were gonna be here with him today, and you let me propose to you.
i didn't- i know that giving you that ring was stupid.
that's fine.
and maybe this wasn't gonna work out between us.
but this you should've told me about this.
well, it's hard, you know? to choose the people we fall in love with.
to love only one person at a time.
people like us are more complicated.
us? i'm sorry.
i'm here with friends.
ellen, you're a regular here, right?
you ever see that woman before? in the corner?
oh only when i came in and wondered when they were gonna start enforcing a dress code.
ellen, the bathroom's over here.
are you serious?
let's go.
lee adama, you amaze me.
shh.
this is it now.
you ready?
yes.
we're with you.
do it.
everybody by the bar! now! move!
you, you-t up against the bar oh, my gods.
three men, one wan, all armed.
is it true the fleet knows i'm on galactica?
i'm interested in navigational weaknesses.
worm holes, dark matter blind spots.
likely ambushes.
i would avoid these pulsar pointers because of dradis interference.
if i was gonna plan an ambush, i'd do it there.
it depends, admiral.
they adapt to your every move.
every move triggers a counter-move.
adapt.
that's what you're good at, right?
why won't you answer my question?
does the fleet know i'm on galactica?
mm.
it's the baby.
she's kicking.
the fleet knows.
that'll be all for today.
s.
you know, if people knew how much you've relied on that thing's so-called intelligence, they'd be scared out of their wits.
what about you, saul? are you afraid of her? you know, the truth is i don't like the way it gotten under your skin.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? the pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression. the only way help's getting in is with a raft of high explosives.
or we could just let these clowns open the pressure door for us.
there's bound to be a security force on its way soon.
open the door for us?
why would they do that?
gimme your drink.
let me talk to them. the ice- i need the dry ice.
okay, stay calm.
ellen!
please don't shoot.
who are you?
ellen tigh.
get over here.
now.
move.
we are not criminals.
we are members of the fleet, just like you.
my husband's xo of galactica.
you've just made the worst mistakes of your life.
colonel tigh, admiral- you need to hear this.
saul- ellen?
what's wrong?
they're holding us hostage.
they're threatening to kill us! my name is sesha abinell.
i have seized control of the cloud nine lounge and held the people in it hostage.
what do you want?
what i want this is not about what i want.
the colonial fleet has become a cylon-occupied territory.
you are working in collusion with a cylon agent- the very same model of a cylon who tried to murder you, admiral adama, on your own ship.
we want sharon valerii.
you have two hours.
get me everything you can on sesha abinell.
yes, sir.
sesha abinell fleet records indicate she's the widow of a ray abinell. he was a casualty aboard the greenleaf freighter when the cylons hit it about ten weeks ago.
widow.
who do we have aboard cloud nine?
uh, rotation schedule shows captain adama, half a marine squad, and starbuck's already there on & r. get me starbuck right away.
yes, sir.
hell, one of you beauties has got to be an o-2 sensor.
and i'm guessing it's you.
take a sip of carbon dioxide.
there was another guy at the bar.
check the back.
we don't want any more mistakes.
kern, ere's anawful lot of military types here.
and that's why we're here.
to get galactica's attention, remember?
page.
you go.
no problem.
good to see ya, gunny.
i'm gonna need some of those gorillas you call marines.
most of my gorillas are already here, sir.
just trying to cop a little & r. tell me about it.
all right, here's what we know.
we got an unknown number of shooters at least 20 hostages.
and about a 90-minute window before they start throwing out bodies.
you got a plan, sir? lock and load.
let's figure out the rest as we go along.
put your weapon down.
tell them. he says he's captain adama from the galactica.
he just wants to talk.
talk, that's it.
just talk.
they're together.
put it down.
or she dies.
hey, she dies, he dies, you get it?
difference is, you won't do it.
he will.
okay?
we all have someone we care about.
it's his son.
he's not gonna choose the cylon over his son.
get in line with the others.
co-2 is through the roof.
they're trying to suffocate us.
what is this, a trap?
there's a reason you don't just start shooting on a spaceship.
you probably nicked a line.
why don't you let me talk to the admiral, see if we can't find a way out of this? i've got two strike teams inbound to you.
eta ten minutes.
we'll have plenty of fire power, so that's good.
but i'm concerned with limited accesedints.
admiral.
it's abinell.
keep starbuck on the line with us.
adama.
we're losing oxygen.
if it's not restored, the hostages die.
then you'll all die.
because this is over.
not until the cylon's dead.
i'm willing to die to see this through.
you willing to risk your son's life?
son of a bitch.
suddenly you're listening.
gods damn it, give her what she wants!
give her the cylon!
you're all alone on this, admiral.
i'm not gonna sacrifice a military asset on your altar of revenge.
what are you talking about?
this isn't a- you said this was about us being played by the cylons.
but it isn't.
it's about the loss of your husband, and i understand that.
it's about you wanting to strike back, and i understand that too.
but we've all lost people that we care about.
an learn to live with it.
i am sure you are aware, admiral, of the concrete evidence that caprica's defenses were compromised by a cylon agent who infiltrated the ministry of defense on the eve of the attacks.
people look for complicated answers when something terrible happens.
maybe we were just caught by surprise and were beaten.
and maybe we have to learn to live with that.
and maybe you are just missing the point.
you were infiltrated.
you. the military.
and you are being infiltrated again right now.
you can sit there and pretend you know what you're doing, but you do not.
you are being played.
and the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship.
i want this air system restored right now.
one person comes in alone, fixes it, leaves.
anything goes wrong, somebody gets hurt, it's on your head.
keep a direct line open to cloud nine.
what do we do?
we repair the air system.
saul, we can't give her sharon.
i hope you know that, right?
i know that.
we can't start dealing with the terrorists.
we start now, it'll open the floodgates, and it'll never stop.
but by the way, it's not sharon.
it's a frakkin' cylon.
you don't think i know that?
i think there's part of you that looks into that thing's eyes and still sees that yo trl that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot.
well, it's not.
it never was.
bill, it's a machine.
admiral?
it's captain thrace.
sitrep.
i had one of the cloud nine techs double-check the oxygen feed in there.
there's nothing wrong with the air.
could be a glitch.
or maybe someone screwed with one of the co-2 censors inrs bar.
lee.
why? maybe he's giving us an opening.
if i can get someone inside, get a clear idea of what we're dealing with- kara, this is a recon mission.
get someone to volunteer.
then you assess the situation.
and then get the hell out of there.
do you understand? yes, sir.
i'm here to repair the o-2 line.
captain, what are you doing?
volunteering.
let me see that.
close the hatch.
search her.
you might not want to do that.
you're running out of air in here.
looks clean.
do your job.
cover her.
wait a minute.
turn around slowly.
check the box again.
we're hot.
let's go.
get down!
get down!
we gotta get out!
now! come on!
billy.
billy.
i need shirts, towels- anything i can use as a bandage.
billy!
nobody said you could move.
you still want the cylon?
do you?
because if the admiral's son dies, you're not gonna get a deal, you get that?
if he dies, you're not gonna get what you want.
he's right.
let him go.
sir, it's starbuck.
we got a report of .
what's happening?
my cover was blown.
i had to move.
i'm sorry.
any casualties?
two marines.
probably kia at least one of the gunmen and lee. it was crazy in there, confused.
he got hit.
how bad? i don't know.
stand by.
hold your position.
make no move unless you hear from me. it was friendly fire.
lee got hit by friendly fire.
i think it was me.
i gotta stop the bleeding.
i can't tell if it hit an artery, or lee? don't leave me.
lee, lee.
don't leave me, okay?
please.
hey.
he's gonna be okay.
he's gonna be okay.
just hang in there, come on.
stay with me.
please, stay with me.
are you playing with us? are you playing with me? i've saved the ship.
saved you.
how many times now?
five?
six? you just can't believe i'm not plotting against you.
you know that there are cylons within this fleet.
you know what they look like.
you know where to find them.
if i were to ask you, would you tell me who they are?
no. that i believe.
he'll be all right.
thanks for the concern.
she loses a husband, and suddenly the world owes her an explanation.
he was a good man.
and he wasn't just her husband.
he was my brother.
my brother died on picon. he was a good man too.
they're all good men.
the abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press before they took over the bar.
it's mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories about cylons in the military and the government.
bunch of crap.
it's getting a lot of attention.
we gotta get our people out of there.
you have marines on cloud nine.
pressure door to the room has been resealed.
if we try blowing it open, we'll need so much g-4, we'd risk killing everyone inside.
there are no options left except for one.
no.
we don't strike deals with terrorists.
we can't.
we give them sharon valerii, we're inviting terrorism and we weaken our position permanently, you know that.
gentlemen, everyone in that room is someone's son, someone's wife, someone's mother.
billy is the closest thing that i have to family left in this world.
and if you don't think that that confuses things emotionally for me- let's not be naive.
what if they're right?
what if sharon has been playing us all, plotting our destruction with every passing day? what if the terrorists are right?
this isn't about sharon.
it's about something much bigger than that.
it's about the long-term survival, it's about the way we conduct ourselves in all of this.
sir? it's abinell on the line.
how's my son? alive.
but my friend is dead.
so are two of your soldiers.
and your son's dying.
you know, i thought a long time about this.
about what i'd do about how far i'd go and i honestly did not know until this moment chu.
what?
what?
get on your feet.
what are you gonna do? saul, give them what they want!
it's just a machine!
they're gonna kill her.
hold your fire.
i'm giving you the cylon.
but you won't be alive.
what does that mean? that is not the deal.
it means that you've convinced me that wy have been played.
and if that be the case, and she's been playing with me, then i can't take any more chances.
so you make up your mind.
if you wanshon valerii, you can have her.
but on my terms.
i give you the body, you give me the hostages.
done.
cut the wire.
admiral.
let me help.
please.
let me take it from here.
let's go.
stop looking at him, billy.
i can see you watching him.
i know you think you can get that gun.
i'm only thinking in case something happens.
no.
you're not a soldier.
you're not trained for that.
you've got nothing to prove.
i know.
they're right outside.
we open up, they'll give us the body.
okay.
we're opening the door.
but if anything goes wrong we start killing hostages.
do it.
it's over.
wait- this isn't right.
this one's been dead for weeks.
their cylon is still alive.
kill the girlfriend.
down, report.
all clear.
i need help over here!
medic!
lee.
lee, can you hear me? lee! can you hear me, lee? come on, son.
come on, hurry up.
that's good.
billy.
no.
billy. is this what you gave 'em? it was a calculated risk.
it wasn't worth it.
oh, dear.
well, that's better.
that's better.
he was so young.
hey.
hey what is it?
nothing.
when you're feeling better, we can talk.
this was a hell of a vacation.
yeah.
lee? lee, you can't leave.
you have to stay.
you have to really stay.
you understand? it's okay.
i'll be here when you wake up.
i'll be right here.
previously on battlestar galactica i started thinking about damages you can't see.
hairline fractures in all the beams.
it's throughout the entire ship.
it's our baby, saul.
we'd come to believe that a lack of god's love is what prevented us from biological reproduction.
and our love produced a child.
let him go now.
take him now.
saul, stay with the fleet.
it's all starting to happen, it's the miracle right here.
stay with the fleet!
ellen, you're the fifth.
what are you doing?
forgiving you. is this gonna work?
i have no idea, sir.
this is the stuff?
yeah.
can i touch it?
yeah.
it's gooey.
but it hardens.
becomes like cartilage.
it's flexible, strong.
it's what the baseship's made of. is this alive?
heads up.
heads up, marines.
stay back.
stay back and everyone will get their share!
stay back!
everyone'll get their share.
hey, cylon.
i don't want any trouble.
well, you got trouble.
this better work.
kid's got a heart like a kettle drum.
go on, get out of here.
make room for some sick people.
you should stay here for the night.
i don't trust that machine.
i know.
the irony is irresistible.
the baby's fine.
liam is fine.
you know i'd sleep better at home with you.
sitrep.
sir, we're picking up a bogey on dradis.
raptor.
squawks colonial, but it's not on the roster.
it's one of ours, but we logged it as lost over a year ago, sir.
galactica, permission to board.
raptor 702, your transmission's all garbled.
if you can hear me, give me a flash.
copy, 702.
galactica, they're receiving.
red leader, red turkey, the voice.
i think that's an eight.
starbuck, galactica actual.
report.
galactica, red leader.
our heavy raider buddy's calling the inbound a sharon.
an eight.
starbuck, bring it in.
copy that.
my gods.
it's ellen tigh.
bill.
how many dead chicks are out there? i can't tell you how happy i am to see you.
aren't you gonna help a lady down off this thing?
nice to see you again.
this is boomer.
marines.
take this number eight to the brig.
battlestar galactica season - episode 16 -= lords of kobol =- he wants to rebuild resurrection.
he wants us to rebuild it.
i really think cavil's completely unbalanced.
it's too much for him, the thought that the the only hope for the cylon people is this desperate grab for procreation, evolution, all that messy biological trial and error.
dear.
i'm totally throwing you, aren't i? i'm still ellen, you know.
does anyone have something to drink?
maybe a flask?
so boomer helped you escape.
yes.
i hope you won't treat her too badly.
you don't need to worry about boomer.
may i see them? the others?
galen, tory, and sam? imagine, bill, laura, imagine instead of there are only five.
five people.
imagine how close you'd be.
and then to have all that torn away.
it's all right, ellen.
it's over now.
how much do you remember?
not much from before.
flashes.
samuel anders was badly injured.
he's not responding.
my god.
he's not dead.
there's hope.
i want to see him.
i want to see him and the others.
we'll see what we can do.
i can't believe you're here.
there is so much i have to ask you.
there's so i have to tell you.
you'd better say it fast.
ellen, wait.
floor or table?
i don't care.
gaius!
jeanne.
welcome back.
i missed you.
let me look at you.
paulla.
we were wondering if you were coming back.
if? of course i was coming back!
course i was.
so.
what did i miss?
what's been going on?
well, it got pretty bad after you left, gaius.
they'd bring us supplies and men would come and take them away by force.
it was we were very tired, gaius.
we realized we'd been abandoned and we had to take care of ourselves.
abandoned?
i how could you i wouldn't say that.
i wouldn't say abandoned by god. that i might.
i might say that.
there were dead men in the halls with guns in their hands.
so we took their guns.
now we can protect our food and we can protect ourselves.
all of this all of this is food, gaius.
we're taking care of ourselves now.
i knew if i stayed away that you'd find the strength.
and you have.
it's one of the reasons why i stayed away as long as i did.
that was wise of you, gaius.
sheep have a new shepherd, gaius.
that's what i call a big welcome.
very impressive.
so who'd you frak? what?
come on.
you don't think i know your repertoire after thousands of years of marriage?
it's okay.
i'm not mad.
you thought i was dead.
ellen.
who was it?
well, if you really it was a six.
caprica-six.
we made sixes.
we created her.
that's just i thought of you.
always.
i thought of you.
what do you mean? when you please do not tell me i was your mental porn.
that's just sad.
well, are you still seeing her? yes.
lot of visitors.
just don't anybody unplug anything.
oh, my.
i never thought i would see this.
yes, this is how it was.
tory.
galen.
all those years.
the poor boy.
such bad timing.
we've been thinking.
we belong together.
join us on the baseship.
we'll jump away.
start a new life.
please consider the offer.
it would mean so much to us.
abandon the fleet.
this is your offer? the priority of the fleet is the survival the survival of humans.
we're not safe in this fleet.
even today a cylon was assaulted.
i agree.
this is about the survival of the original 13th tribe in its purest form.
did you put this idea in their heads?
it won't work, of course.
the child, hera, is the hope for a new blended future.
that used to be true.
but now there's another way.
caprica-six's unborn baby is pure cylon.
we can rebuild a pure cylon civilization.
even if we don't find a planet to colonize, we can live indefinitely on the baseship.
look at him.
he'd die over there.
we can take care of him better than here.
the cylon family can survive.
we can start over.
caprica-six is pregnant?
you got her pregnant?
i i did.
yeah.
i didn't know.
i was surprised.
it was a great surprise to all of us. the mating of an original cylon.
you are our children.
can we talk about the offer, maybe deal with the baby later?
are we going or? of course not.
anders specifically said do not abandon the fleet.
so you love her then.
last thing he ever said.
he's not saying anything now.
i'm going with the baseship.
even after you knew for frak's sake.
you made us all filthy in this.
you just can't stop poisoning me.
poison more and more of it until i'm swimming in it!
stop this.
i'm staying on galactica.
you hear me? you can go if you're so mad.
wait.
we won't leave with just one or two of the five.
it has to be all of you or none of you.
so you need to vote and the outcome will bind all of you.
majority rule.
it's what cylons do.
it's a legacy from you.
fine.
so it's a vote?
all right.
i vote we go.
great.
that's me and you.
we don't really know what anders would vote.
yeah, we do. he said he'd stay.
all those years we tried to have children and we never could.
you must've been  your shiny, shiny head off. it was impossible.
you didn't love me.
so what are you saying?
do you vote to stay or to go? i haven't decided yet.
two to go.
two to stay.
and the swing vote is walking out the door.
we come to dogsville more often now.
we don't feel the need to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world.
we trade here.
sometimes, we sell the jewelry that we made.
that's how we got so much food.
yes, jeanne.
since you've been gone, we've been trying to focus on life.
gaius, come on.
hello.
what's your name?
naia.
naia.
that's a very beautiful name.
and who's this? stand up.
stand up.
this is gaius.
really?
i'm very flattered it was his father's name.
to have the same name as his father.
it's very are you hungry?
you look a bit hungry.
he's hungry?
they're all hungry.
are they?
paulla, we've got some food, haven't we? to share with this lot of people?
we're gonna need it eventually to eat, to trade.
we can't.
really, paulla.
are we going to enjoy this food with children starving?
now ask yourself this question really.
look aroun, look at these childr it's not just this child here.
this little gaius.
but he is very cute, this one.
it's all the children, isn't it?
all of them.
and you're putting the food listen to me! listen to me! i'm coming back here.
and if it is the last thing i do, i will ensure that every single one of you are fed and your children are fed, as god is my witness!
caprica.
that's funny.
i don't think i've ever called you a name before.
i think you probably called me some names.
i haven't had the chan no, i haven't taken the opportunity to congratulate you and the baby.
i just wondered if everything was all right with ellen being back.
i heard about the assault in dogsville.
and on behalf of the fleet, i wanted to apologize to you.
thank you. it's very kind of you.
caprica, sometimes i think about the visions that we shared and the talk we had.
i haven't had one in a while.
have you?
not the whole time i've been pregnant.
that never occurred to me. are you saying that this ch what? is this child important?
yes, i think he's very important.
he's my baby and i love him.
he's very important to me. of course he is. of course, all children are important.
yes.
indeed.
thank you for asking about him.
you're welcome.
when'd you get a piano?
gin.
you see ellen and tigh on the wing of that bird?
it's like watching my parents make out.
you go see boomer in the brig yet?
no.
you should go when she's asleep.
i watched sam until i just couldn't handle the fun anymore.
there you are.
look at you.
you haven't changed much.
how did you get the s to bring you here?
i thought maybe we could have a drink.
where's the booze?
i have tea.
god no.
listen, i wanted to talk to you.
things between me and saul just got so crazy.
i step off that raptor and boom, we're making love.
and less than a day later, i'm i'm  at him.
but we were always, always, always like that.
anyway, i just i wanted to assure you. he didn't tell you about the sex.
frak.
i'm i come here to try to be good and look.
don't worry.
seriously.
because you have all the proof right there that he loves you.
you know, when we were still trying to have our own, he always brought up the name liam.
pure cylon baby.
if simon knew, he'd want it so badly.
i'll take care of this child.
that wasn't a threat, caprica.
no. it was a threat.
i don't know why you couldn't have children, ellen.
sometimes love must not be enough because he loved you.
yes, this this is rough.
but what can i do? if i make him choose between you and me, i know the best i could do would be to tear him in half.
don't.
i won't.
you win. the man loves you. in fact, i'd say there isn't much he loves more.
here you go, gaius.
here you go.
here you go.
take that to mommy.
here you go.
there you go. the marines tried this already, gaius, and people started pushing and grabbing.
the marines have assault rifles, not handguns.
look around you, paulla, will you?
look around.
can you see anybody rioting?
can you?
no.
there's no uniforms here.
come, come.
there's no sense of oppression.
it's just it's just one soul touching another, isn't it?
well, we need the food.
paulla, when you share your food, god makes it tenfold.
you watch me.
you're going to learn something.
you're gonna want to step away from those.
really?
and who will you be? step away from the supplies.
ladies, show this man we are armed.
do it.
take it off the safety, jeanne.
ours are bigger.
careful so the five of you together at last.
any mythic revelations?
nope.
nothing to report, sir.
you were born, right, saul?
what?
you were born.
on earth.
yeah.
i don't remember.
but i wouldn't anyway.
nature of the process, right?
not very machine-like of you.
great grandpa was a power sander.
they're puttin' the stuff into her.
the cylon goop you said.
yeah.
if it works, she'll still be the galactica on the outside, but she won't know what she is anymore.
it'll save her. that along with cylons flying cap.
we need their help.
i need your help.
laura and lee know it.
they don't think i see it.
but i do.
i see it.
you never told me that the sons of aries were involved in this. of course they are, gai.
did you think they would stay out of something as valuable as food supplies?
well, you didn't want to be king of the fools anymore.
no, the only thing worse than being leader of this lot would be being one of them.
did you really want to feed those people?
i enjoyed it, actually.
i did enjoy giving.
i loved it, actually.
the more i did it done it long enough, i'd have given them my heart.
well, do you think she's telling them anything as moving as that?
do you think she's giving them hope?
she's not, is she? what's paulla been saying to you? has paulla been saying that we mustn't help others?
because i disagree.
has paulla been saying that we can't help others because we're too weak?
i disagree.
oh, paulla.
i am so disappointed with you.
i'm disappointed with all of you.
here you all are.
i'm gone for three minutes and you're lap up paulla's icy pragmatism.
there is a way to feed ourselves and the people from dogsville!
there is a way to bring hope to the lower decks.
to the whole of this poor ship.
there is a way to win! she thinks we can't get what we need.
she thinks we can't get what we need.
all we need is strength.
all we need is strength!
and strength comes from within.
we can get more guns.
better guns.
bigger guns.
and guns! more guns.
bigger guns.
better guns.
and when we have those, we will win!
thanks for seeing me alone.
i just i have to talk to you. of course.
hate me, i'll take it.
but this is bigger than that.
galactica needs the baseship.
why did you even make love to me, saul, when your real love was at home? did you even hear what i said?
bill needs the baseship.
i heard you.
did you hear me? her brush is where mine used to be.
my dresses are gone.
she shares our bed.
do you remember, i got us that mattress.
you went to my quarters.
not interrupting?
not at all.
i was expecting you.
you called him?
good.
come on in.
you too, caprica.
what is this?
we're joining the baseship.
all of us.
we can jump away when you're ready.
thank you. it's the right decision.
no.
no, it's not.
no. the vote is you and anders versus me, tory and galen.
caprica, obviously, that means you have to come too.
wouldn't you like to raise your child where it's safe?
i want him to be safe, yes.
she doesn't understand what this means.
i used to think hera was the only hope for us.
but clearly that's just not true anymore.
her baby, he's pure cylon.
if we go off and make some pure cylon culture, that's what happened on earth and it led to disaster.
pure human doesn't work.
pure cylon doesn't work.
it's too weak.
you just don't want to leave the one you really love.
what?
talk to me.
what is this?
it's petty and vile.
enough.
she's voted.
when's the jump?
we can be ready in an hour.
i'm not goin'.
we agreed on majority rule.
frak, apparently we invented majority rule.
but i don't remember it, so frak that.
saul, don't let her all right, go.
go.
all of you.
caprica.
go.
go be pure and safe and whatever the frak.
i'm not goin'.
do you see, little girl?
there is something in the universe that he loves far more than you or me and that's bill adama.
you don't even want to go. this is all to hurt me.
bill adama, the ship and the uniform.
how can you sink so low?
everything else takes second place.
why doing this? i knew i did.
but i always wondered if a baby would.
guess i know now.
something's wrong get cottle.
you'll be okay.
never seen anyone get into trouble so fast, but he's fighting back.
that's all i can tell you.
i didn't mean this.
yeah, you did.
here, this may help increase his heart rate.
you knew how i would have to choose.
you knew what it meant.
i'm sorry. of course, cylons and humans need to stay together.
but i always intended i just i didn't think.
saul, i only wanted to hurt you, not her.
you didn't think i would hurt her, if i let her go.
it never occurred to you? no wonder we had to invent them some compassionate god to believe in.
we couldn't have them deify us, could we? we didn't invent anything.
shut up.
just stop!
i'm so sorry.
maybe i just shouldn't be here.
first intelligent thing you've said.
talk to her. tell her you love her.
it's what she needs.
it's what the baby needs.
listen.
i love you, all right?
can you hear me? this is nonsense.
she knows it.
i don't need to say it.
i shouldn't need to say it to anyone.
isn't it enough that i feel it?
just tell her.
i feel it.
for her. for you.
for liam.
shouldn't need to spout the words.
i feel it less with words.
just let me gods damn feel it and i'll fill the frakkin' room.
his heart rate is drop.
i got signs of distress all over.
doesn't look good.
i am so sorry.
cut him out.
even if it kills me.
he'll live if you cut him out right now.
cylon babies must be strong, right?
hera was born early.
cut him out.
i am not cutting you.
forget it.
he'll never make it.
four months?
no.
please.
caprica, listen, i have to tell you. he loves you more than he ever loved me.
you are the mother of his son. the boy is alive.
i can see his heartbeat on the monitor.
and that's proof.
proof he loves you. he loves you so much.
it's shining out of him.
you and he can stay on galactica.
i'll go away with the others.
and you can be together.
a little family.
i promise it.
that's it.
i'm sorry.
no, that was me.
that was me.
i take it back.
i'm sorry.
the lady and i have some work to do.
it's time for you to leave.
you have to go now.
nurse!
out now. she's in good hands.
the two of you can stay here and listen to this.
where are you going?
i'm gonna go to the head.
do something constructive.
a little project i've been working on.
listen to me, admiral.
just wait.
explain what you mean.
what you have right now is starving civilians with no representation, no recourse.
they're broken.
they're exhausted.
they've had enough.
that's not a mutiny, admiral.
that is a revolution.
and you can maintain order?
listen to me.
list please, admiral!
galactica is slip away from you drop by drop.
you are pouring cylon blood into her veins.
i see the cylon pilots. we all see them.
we all see the cylon workforce.
where are they going into the far recesses of the ship?
when are you inviting the centurions over to join in all the fun we're having over here? of course, when you do that, that very moment, this becomes a blended ship.
only half human.
and right now i am here to tell you, your people your people are not ready for that.
listen to me, admiral.
i am offering you the last human solution you will ever be presented with.
well, guys, you did it.
i don't know how, but you did.
i told you, paulla.
i told you.
you do good deeds and you are rewarded.
you're rewarded ten tenfold.
and then if you give then you receive, don't you? that was beautiful.
i'm sorry.
liam.
his name was liam.
it's a good name.
short for william.
yeah.
it's not like that.
i know.
i know it's not.
i know.
it's okay.
it's okay.
these are the cylons that have died with us since the alliance.
i didn't know they were doing that.
did you?
it's already happened, hasn't it?
previously on battlestar galactica leoben's a very clever cylon.
he's gonna try to get into your head.
we haven't been properly introduced.
i'm leoben.
i want the cylon interrogated.
do it.
this has happened before.
and all of it will happen again.
your destiny's already been written.
i saw your x-rays.
a lot of old fractures from childhood.
children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
get out!
i'm trying to help you, kara.
i only want you to see the truth of your life.
the reason why you suffered and why you've struggled for so long.
what if there's something to what leoben said about you and a special destiny?
kara thrace and her special destiny?
that sounds more like a bad cover band, sam.
i think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this temple.
maybe it was a road sign showing the direction that they headed to next.
curious about something.
those paintings you did from your apartment on caprica this was on the temple.
where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
that was just something i've been doodling since i was a kid.
i liked the pattern.
well, they built the temple what is it?
just something leoben said once. that i had a destiny.
that it had already been written.
what's up? nothing, go back to sleep.
you're up early.
you too.
yeah.
hera gets these nightmares.
wakes up  and shaking.
until i calm her down, i can't go back to sleep, i'm wide awake.
all that crap she went through on new caprica really left its mark on her.
yeah, i know just how she feels.
i wish you never showed me that picture of that frakking mandala.
i dream about it and that bastard leoben every gods damned night.
i feel like i'm losing my mind here.
you know, kara, there's a psychiatrist aboard inchon velle.
we've made an appointment for hera.
maybe you should think about seeing her. are you kidding me? most shrinks are more frakked than their patients are.
you know, you might want to check out that oracle camped in dogsville.
people say she interprets dreams.
sees things in them.
predicts events.
you okay? i don't know.
hello? the goddess aurora.
take it.
it's yours.
what the hell am i gonna do with this? you'll know when the time comes.
sit.
i i can't sleep.
i have these nightmares.
about the cylon? the one who held you captive on new caprica.
leoben.
i know that he was just he knows you better than you know yourself, kara thrace.
he sees the truth about you.
about your destiny.
you don't enough of that.
the only destiny i have is as a world-class frak-up.
who hurts everyone she cares about.
that was your mother's gift to you, wasn't it?
you were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
your life is a testament to pain.
you want to believe it because it means that you're bad luck.
you're like a cancer that needs to be removed.
because you hear her voice every day.
and you want her to be right.
somebody told you what leoben said to me? did you ever tell anyone about that?
you learned the wrong lesson from your mother, kara.
you confused the messenger with the message.
your mother was trying to teach you something else.
you don't know crap about my mother.
leoben does. he sees the patterns.
sees how it all fits together.
shut up.
he's coming for you.
soon.
shut the frak up.
you can't stop him.
and he will show you the way.
battlestar galactica season - episode 17  maelstrom  thanks, insults, critics transcript = 1000fr.com
- kotaro, lama, nikomagnus = lords of kobol - i'm on a shuttle in a half an hour.
ask for your leave.
come with me.
you could use the down time.
that sounds tempting.
so do it.
no strings, okay?
we don't even have to talk about our relationship.
i'll think about it.
which means no.
you know, i hate to say this, but that whack-job oracle, she's got a point.
your mother frakked up your head long before leoben ever got to you.
she was dealing with a lot, sam.
she told me that i was different from other kids.
that i needed to be a warrior like her. tought me that fear, it gets you killed.
and anger keeps you alive.
well, she gave you plenty to be angry about, didn't she? split your head open with a broomstick handle because you didn't make your bed.
i ever tell you how i got back at her? no.
during the first cylon war, she was stationed with the first marines on mehidra.
stinking jungles, you wouldn't believe.
had this phobia of insects for the rest of her life.
hated the damn things.
so i go out and i buy a bunch of rubber bugs, and i slip into her closet.
and i put them all over her shoes.
and? she screamed her frakkin' head off.
i go in.
and she's trying to smash them with her shoes.
but that's just making them bounce around even more.
you must have caught hell for that.
she grabbed my hand, held it in the doorjamb and slammed the door.
oh, frak me. it was worth it though.
fleet refueling operations day catbird, galactica.
we've had a couple valve failures.
we're restarting the unrep.
that's just great.
hotdog, settle in.
we're gonna be out here another three hours.
hotdog, what the hell are you doing?
enjoying blue skies again.
about the only thing i miss about new caprica.
galactica, starbuck-- showtime.
bogey, my right-one.
in the soup at 45. committing.
starbuck, hotdog, no joy.
press.
abort the unrep.
unhook those fuel lines.
immediately.
refueling ships,galactica.
immediate.
cease all underway replenishment ops.
sir, we got both starbuck and hotdog on dradis.
but no contact on the bogey.
we're lucky we can see anything.
that planet's synchrotron radiation has been kicking the crap out of every dradis in the fleet since we got here.
price you pay for a good place to hide and refuel the fleet.
look's like it's also a good place for hiding a cylon raider.
starbuck, apollo.
what do you got? apollo, we got one turkey playing hide and seek in the clouds.
no sparrows.
engaging offensive.
one heavy raider.
no fighter escort.
still no bandits on dradis.
if that bastard jumps, the cylons could be all over us in minutes.
alert the fleet to stand by for an emergency jump.
starbuck, hotdog.
no visual on your raider and i'm losing you.
damn it, starbuck, blind!
i say again.
i lost you in the clouds.
starbuck, we have no dradis contact on your bogey.
do you have visual?
affirmative, he's hiding in the clouds.
he just ducked into the storm system.
do you see him?
do you see him?
galactica, starbuck.
tally.
weapons hot.
damn it!
galactica, starbuck.
took a hit.
still flying.
starbuck, are you nominal?
caught me under the chin but everything's green.
where the hell is that raider?
sir.
starbuck's drop close to the planetary hard deck.
if she continues the atmospheric density will keep her from reaching orbit again.
then the pressure will crush her like a cheap soda can.
starbuck, you're getting too low.
break off and climb.
i repeat: starbuck, you're getting too low.
break off and climb.
starbuck starbuck, pull out before you don't have the smash to regain orbit.
starbuck, come in.
where the hell's she going?
starbuck get outta there.
starbuck, come in.
do you read?
starbuck, you're getting too low.
break off and climb.
get up.
hotdog, do you have a visual on starbuck?
starbuck, come in.
do you read?
starbuck, pull out! that is an order.
pull out.
son of a bitch.
apollo, starbuck.
wilco.
come on!
where did i take the hits, chief?
looks like nowhere, captain.
what?
i felt the impact.
damn viper felt like i hit a brick wall.
well, we'll keep checking, but so far, not a scratch.
gods damn it, it has to be there.
run it again.
we watched it twice already.
then this isn't my gun camera film.
no one else pulled the trigger all day.
we checked the dradis records against the ones in our raptor.
there was no paint on your cylon.
and we all know that dradis can be wonky near this planet, karl.
maybe the raider jumped away before you opened fire.
or maybe it never existed to begin with.
it was there.
gonna ground her? cottle says she's physically fit but an emotional basket case. in peace time, he'd ground us all.
so it falls back on you.
yeah.
even screwed up, she's still the best viper driver i've got.
sometimes it's hard to admit that the best of us can burn out.
you think she has? i don't know.
i think her identity as a steely-eyed viper jock is the only thing holding her together.
so then, if i ground her everyone gets rattled sometimes.
but the bottom line is when the bullets start to fly can she handle it?
so where do you want to go when you bite the big one?
i wanna go right there, next to kat. a water-walking viper jock.
royal pain in the ass but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.
you can put me right here.
next to duck and nora.
good card players.
nice way to spend eternity.
okay, so whoever croaks first, the other one makes sure that their picture goes in the right place.
deal?
deal.
so what the old man have to say about my combat report?
starbuck's finally gone off the deep end? unfit for duty? he said i'm the cag.
it's my call.
and what do you say? well, i say i trust your eyes over dradis any day of the week.
something could have been there, vanished in the cloud cover.
so you don't think i'm nuts?
i didn't say that.
you're a raving lunatic.
as demented and deranged as the first day i met you.
and you're a bastard.
look, stress has made us all twitchy after what that cylon put you through on new caprica, you've had more than your share.
get some rest.
or you will start seeing things.
yeah.
that leaves six civvies in line to refuel.
so we have another ten hours, and we're done.
yeah.
starbuck?
what do you hear? nothing but the rain.
well then, grab your gun and bring in the cat.
wilco, admiral.
madam president.
captain.
how is it out there? hell of a view.
we're almost to the finish line.
then we can jump the hell out of this system.
so say we all.
actually, sorry.
boss, i have something for you.
i thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
aurora.
goddess of the dawn.
yeah.
she brings the morning star and a fair wind.
a fresh start.
thank you. good hunting.
thank you. harness assembly?
lap and shoulder retaining pins installed.
retraction reel correct.
disconnect block locking indicate a yellow flag visible.
you all right, captain give me a minute here, chief.
she's just sitting there.
well, did you talk to her you talk to her. feeling sorry for me everyone gets rattled.
even the best.
i'm not going back out there.
i don't trust myself.
so trust me.
i'll fly your wing.
the cag flying my number two whatever it takes.
how are things with you and dee you know, good.
no.
better than good.
best they've ever been.
i'm happy for you.
really.
it's funny though, after all we've been through, we are right back where we started.
you're a cag.
and i am your hotshot problem pilot.
i guess that's all we'll ever be now starbuck, apollo.
how we doin' copasetic.
another thirty minutes and we head back to the barn damn it.
apollo, one turkey.
my right-three.
level at ten, ducking in and out of the clouds.
engaging.
starbuck, apollo.
no joy.
starbuck, galactica.
no dradis contact on your cylon.
apollo, starbuck.
weapons hot.
committing.
this time, i'm gonna drag him back and dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.
set the fleet at condition one.
uncouple the hoses.
starbuck, apollo.
i've lost you on dradis.
i'm blind.
starbuck, apollo.
i repeat.
i got no sign of you or the raider.
starbuck report.
starbuck, report.
this is apollo.
do you read me starbuck, report starbuck starbuck, i have zero visibility.
starbuck, are you out there kara good morning, delphi.
got another hot one in store for you today.
time to head for the beach.
weatherman says we can expect-- rise and shine.
we have a big day ahead of us.
come on.
i'm not here.
i'm out cold. or on a cylon ship, and you drugged me to play your frakkin' mind games.
no games, kara.
pas de son pas de transcript.
i write my own destiny.
i didn't paint that symbol, kara.
you did. in the clouds.
didn't you you didn't tell anyone else. because you're drawn to it.
you feel its pull.
you want to fly into it.
you want to cross over.
but you're afraid.
afraid of what a frakkin' cloud? of the unknown.
death.
all of your high wire stunts have been an act.
time after time.
you skip to the edge of the abyss, then dance away again.
but you never really conquered your fear.
you've been afraid ever since that day.
what day all of this has happened before.
and will happen again.
it's open.
hello, momma.
it's hard to believe it's only six years ago.
you look so much younger.
i was.
so you really did it first person in the family to become an officer.
what is the world coming to kara,they tell me that you're the best natural pilot they've ever seen.
the first time i got in that cockpit, i just felt like i belonged.
all that natural ability.
and still you only graduated sixteenth in your class.
16th out of 117 cadets, mom.
why are you proud of that you should have been number one.
they tell me that you have left a trail of demerits from here to aerilon.
you're undisciplined, you have no respect for authority.
it's none of your business anymore.
you have a gift, kara.
i've always known that here in my gut.
and i am not gonna let you piss that away.
you're special.
don't you understand that?
no, i'm not.
would you let go of that stupid dream of yours?
look, i am sorry as hell that you never made officer.
and all you have to show for a life of dedication is this crappy apartment and that frakkin' medal on the wall.
but i will not make up for it all.
i can't.
yeah, because you're a quitter.
you always have been.
you went to an oncologist?
hey, put that down.
don't touch that!
what are you gonna do about this? nothing.
there's nothing to do.
it's metastasized.
game is over.
i'm sorry, momma.
i don't want your pity.
you haven't got it.
you wanna feel sorry for someone?
feel sorry for yourself.
you'll have to find another way to motivate your ass.
i'm not gonna be around to do it any longer.
don't tell me you're gonna cry about it now.
you know, i don't need this, i'm i'm gonna walk out that door.
and you can look at it every frackin' miserable day you have left, and know that i am never gonna come back through it again.
kara! kara! you kept running, didn't you? for blocks.
she waited here.
five weeks.
ho you'd come back.
she died alone.
i was afraid.
i couldn't watch.
it's not too late.
she's waiting still.
momma.
you came back.
i can't believe you kept all this.
everything.
always.
momma.
something's about to happen.
you know that thing that you were trying to prepare me for?
i don't know if i can do it.
oh,yes you can.
you can.
how can you be sure?
you're my daughter.
see, there's nothing so terrible about death.
when you finally face it, it's beautiful.
you're free now to become who you really are.
you're not leoben.
never said i was.
i'm here to prepare you to pass through the next door.
to discover what hovers in the space between life and death.
starbuck, apollo.
lost you on dradis.
i say again.
i've lost you.
squawk ident.
i'll try and get a fix on you.
kara! lee.
i'm not afraid anymore.
say again?
i'm not afraid anymore.
she should be afraid.
she's damn close to the hard deck.
apollo's not far behind.
the pressure will crush 'em both.
come on, lee, get her outta there.
all right, kara, listen to me.
forget the damn toaster.
climb now or you're dead.
we can still pull out of this, we haven't gone past the point of no return.
kara! dee, vector red section to apollo's last known.
set alert vipers to ready one.
hotdog, hex, divert to 715.
gods damn it, where are you?
visual.
visual.
okay.
kara, i'm coming to get you.
lee i'll see you on the other side.
kara, please, listen to me.
come back.
just let me go.
gods damn it, kara! you come back!
come back!
it's okay.
just let me go.
they're waiting for me.
no! no! apollo.
get out of there, abort!
abort!
lee, do you have her in sight?
can you see her? negative.
she she went in.
she went in.
we're sending in the search and rescue birds right now.
we'll find her.
no, dad, it's no use.
her ship's in pieces.
her ship's in pieces.
no chute.
we lost her.
thanks for watching bsg with our subs.
something wrong, captain?
captain?
what the frack is this, chief?
it's a little hydraulic fluid, nothing to worry about.
no? while you're in the troll room, sucking back moonshine, i'll be up in this bird.
if that gear buckles, when i trap, i'll be splattered like frackin' roadkill.
all of this ships leave hydraulic fluid.
seals are old.
we don't have new ones to chief, i'm not interested in lazy ass excuses.
i want the seals replaced.
kara, hey! come on.
previously on battlestar galactica hairline fractures in all the beams.
it's in her bones, admiral.
there's something on the base ship that can help.
it's this organic resin.
it'll grow into the metal.
strengthens it as it matures.
oh, my gods.
it's ellen tigh.
nice to see you again.
this is boomer.
marines.
take this number eight to the brig.
if that's me lying there, then what am i? what am i? reveille, reveille.
up all bunks and turn to.
sweep down all compartments.
empty all trash cans.
make a clean sweep fore and aft.
lay below to the master-at-arms office for muster, all restricted personnel.
attention on deck.
have a seat.
it's 0621.
sync with me in three, two, one.
hack 0621.
our mission is the same this week as it was the week before that, and the week before that.
we'll be flying viper caps in conjunction with heavy raider pickets from the base ship.
those of you who just came back from six-day planet hunts will get two days local duty before going out again.
remember, the first one who sights a habitable rock will get this fine oral hygiene product.
it is the last tube of tauran toothpaste in the universe.
gods know most of you need it.
our mission is the same this week as it was the week before that, and the week before that.
planet hunters, make sure to draw long duration provisions.
if those clapped-out ftls go down when you're out there, you're gonna get mighty hungry waiting for the sar birds to find you.
as you know, the mutiny has thinned our ranks.
we cannot give all you raptor jocks back-seaters.
savor this alone time, but do not whack too much.
we need you to conserve your o2.
learn to savor your alone time.
wank as little as possible.
conserve your o2.
our mission is the same this week as it was the week before that planet search assignments are on the duty board.
be advised the repairs to galactica will continue to cause sporadic power outages.
six has the color assignments and your recognition signals.
engines start at 0710.
good hunting.
so the stop-drilling and the shoring compound will buy the galactica a few more jumps.
but not many.
how many?
impossible to say until the hull caves in.
but we're not ready to give up on the old girl just yet.
well, if there's nothing else, sonja i wanna congratulate you on your election.
i look forward to seeing you taking your seat in the quorum of ship's captains next week.
thank you, but you should know something.
when we convene, i intend to formally request that the eight you're holding in galactica's brig be returned to us.
boomer?
yes, sharon valerii.
she put two holes in me.
i'm afraid i didn't word that right.
we don't want boomer set free.
we wanna try boomer for treason.
sharon valerii sided with cavil in the cylon civil war, which killed thousands of our comrades.
and if she's convicted?
before the civil war, resurrection made capital punishment pointless.
but now that we're all mortal you want to kill her.
battlestar galactica there's a lot still going on in there.
dr.
gerard said these readings are unprecedented and, frankly, bizarre.
they haven't changed in weeks.
and there is nothing to indicate that he's having any kind of conscious thought.
well, maybe his brain is rebooting.
reorganizing as it heals.
the last thing we need is you jerking our chains with a lotta quack ideas.
so why don't you take them someplace else? what if we could link him to a datastream like our hybrids?
his eyes were closed last time.
well, that's not unusual in a coma.
doesn't mean anything.
you're gonna have to come to grips with that.
and how am i supposed to do that?
you need to get on with your life.
if there's any change, you'll be the first one to know.
gods damn it.
do you have to continue to play the same lame-ass song?
give it a rest.
i'm not playing the same lame-ass song.
i'm composing it.
been at it for four days now.
it's it's hell.
so then quit.
what's the point? the point? the point is to bring a little grace and beauty to an otherwise ugly and brutal existence.
oh, gimme a frakking break. is that what you were doing when the cylons attacked the 12 colonies?
did your music stop one missile?
pretty cynical point of view.
something happened to you.
yeah.
i wonder what it could be.
okay, closing time.
drink up and let's go, folks.
i have an observation for you.
you wanna be an immortal composer, you better learn how to play that thing first.
you know, sometimes at work, i try to conjure up what your face looks like.
curve of your lips.
way your hair falls.
how you smell.
you see my face every day.
yeah, but not like this.
you know, what we had it was nothing.
nothing.
you're a machine.
i'm not.
well, whatever i am, i know how i felt.
software doesn't have feelings.
how many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with?
got stuck with the best of limited options?
and why? because the ones we really wanted that we really loved were dead, dying no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
no, hey, hey.
hey, hey, shh, hey, hey.
i love you, chief.
gods damn it.
come on, people, you can't draw your power from the same bus!
you said you had something for me.
come in.
i got something that'll cheer you up.
hey, hera.
whatcha drawing, stars?
those are very good stars.
thank you. recognize any of this? that's my stuff.
when we all thought you were dead yeah, the pilots auctioned it off, i know.
took me a while but i managed to buy, beg, and steal them back.
that for me? thank you. thank you. hey.
what about the rest?
keep it.
thank god. i don't know why i'm here.
you know, when i shot the old man, the things that you said to me the way that you looked at me i thought new caprica was a way to set things right.
you can't force people to love you at the point of a gun.
i know that now.
but at the time i felt betrayed.
so i wanted to forget you and hate you.
didn't work.
i've thought about you every day since that moment i died in your arms.
me too.
if i had known back then what i am i know.
galen, it's okay, really.
i mean, the most important thing is that we both know who we are now.
let's make the most with the time that we have left.
please?
what the hell is this?
our house.
on picon.
it's the one that we planned to build when we mustered out.
stop it.
stop it.
stop this.
i'm sorry, galen.
i thought you'd be okay with cylon projection.
the critic returns.
i thought i'd see if you were making any progress.
you tell me.
it's longer.
lotta notes.
you hate it?
i didn't say that.
you were savagely honest with me the other night.
why be diplomatic now? i'm not being diplomatic, you oversensitive jackass.
i said i liked it.
really?
why? um it's hard to put into words.
um, made me think of someone chasing after a car.
not exactly what i was going for.
i was trying to convey a sense of loss.
that's that's what i meant.
it's like losing someone that you care about.
their car pulls away.
you you chase 'em.
but they're going too fast.
so that's it?
we're just gonna sit on our hands?
let our people kill her for vengeance?
what do you expect us to do? issue a formal decree of clemency?
we can't interfere.
we can't set ourselves up as gods.
the rebels are the aggrieved parties.
can't.
can't, can't they have every right to determine valerii's punishment.
can't!
boomer saved your life.
you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. and i will testify to that at her trial, but i won't try to stop it.
we have to let justice run its course.
then they will kill her.
sure as hell.
we're all in hell.
thanks for your input, colonel. he just lost his child, for god's sake.
you leave him be.
how long you been going there? a while.
became my secret retreat.
a way of feeling close to you.
hey, do you remember how we obsessed over every little detail?
um, that was you obsessing.
i was just listening.
really?
how many floor plans did you draw? um that's being thorough.
we never had a chance to build our house, so i built it in my head.
and i wanted so much to share it with you.
are you sure? i don't want to put you through any okay, we've nailed the first movement.
now how about the second?
it's okay, it's just the next hurdle.
the key is to, you know, not panic.
just trust yourself something's gonna come.
it's just part of the process.
is part of the process also stealing from other composers?
that piece that you're riffing off of, it's nomion's third sonata, second movement.
i mean, it's what it sounded like anyway.
no, you're you're dead on the money.
it's pronounced no-mayan.
anyway, he's my touchstone.
whenever i come up dry, i look to him for inspiration.
and for somebody who hates music so much, you know an awful lot about it.
my dad used to play.
so what's the story? he forced you to learn, and he's such a perfectionist you grew to hate it?
no.
no, i loved it actually.
he used to sit me next to him on the bench when he played.
smell of tobacco on his breath.
he taught me a few songs.
i used to try so hard to get 'em right.
not because i was afraid he'd get angry, but because i knew he'd be so proud.
there was this one song that he taught me. it made me feel happy and sad all at the same time.
the best ones do.
how is it possible that i found my body and i'm still here?
i mean, what am i? a ghost? a demon?
you're asking the wrong guy.
i'm just a piano player.
when i was leading the fleet to earth, everything seemed so clear.
for the first time in my life, i knew what i was doing and why i was here.
now i'm just adrift again.
listen, you may feel like hell.
but sometimes lost is where you need to be.
just because you don't know your direction doesn't mean you don't have one.
madame president.
i'm asking you as a personal favor to me, don't sign that.
hmm.
don't do that, chief.
personal feelings are what sharon valerii preys upon.
you know that better than any of us.
you need to clear your head.
you don't have to kill her.
leave her in the brig.
no.
she is a danger in the brig, out of the brig.
a danger to us, a danger to our cylon allies.
this can't be the last option, madame, please.
madame president, please.
we're done here chief.
you're dismissed.
somebody check the fuse.
hey! what?
what, that was good.
it's crap.
well, maybe you need to take a break.
get yourself laid or something.
that might dissipate the tension.
that why she left you?
that's a pretty deep groove on your finger.
had to have been there for awhile.
too long.
she didn't leave me, i left her.
why? she wanted me to quit playing the piano.
you left her for that?
i was playing steady gigs.
making decent money.
now that we had a kid, she said it wasn't enough. said i had to get a real job.
i told her i might as well cut my heart out.
my gods, you're just like my father.
you start a family, the going gets tough, you ditch 'em.
did you ever stop thinking about yourself long enough to consider what you did to your kid? you got it.
thanks, chief.
every time the godsdamn power goes out we gotta go down and check the locks.
prisoner's still secure.
she slept right through it.
you gonna stay awhile?
word is they're ship her out tomorrow.
no. said all i needed to say.
so maybe what your old man did was wrong.
but he still left you with something.
he taught you how to play the piano.
i never played after he left.
what about that song? that song he taught you. the one that makes you happy and sad at the same time.
play that for me.
i don't frakking remember it.
and even if i did, i wouldn't.
that son-of-a-bitch never came back. he never called.
he never wrote.
so you quit playing to punish him?
come on, play me a song. it won't hurt.
come on.
come on, i'll show you.
it's easy.
come on.
don't make me hurt you.
here we go.
that goes there.
and that goes there.
go ahead.
it's okay.
it's okay.
you play, please.
i'll play.
i'll play if you play.
great.
i hope you're here to fix the frakking shower.
boomer.
athena.
helo.
hey.
i didn't think you'd you didn't think i'd let you go on a six-day mission in deep space without a proper goodbye, did you?
next flight team's not suiting up for another 20.
you smell good.
yeah, i made a trade for some real soap.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
taste as good as it smells?
hey, something wrong?
cottle was right.
i never should have insisted on seeing him.
his eyes were open.
i wasn't ready for that.
little guy was looking right at me. it's all right, i think you i think you almost had it.
something's missing.
oh, it's the left hand.
listen, i'll play down here.
i think i know what you're doing.
now hang on.
holy crap.
hey.
hmm, that's right.
play the bottom, okay?
just come in when you think you're ready.
okay?
hey, baby.
hi.
oh.
guess what mommy brought you? mm, drink it all, yeah.
mm, good, right?
yeah.
oh, we forgot all about her physical today.
hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
lemme give you a hand with that.
oh, easy, easy, chief.
thanks.
what the frak?
that's the song.
where'd you learn to play that song?
i played it as a kid.
my father what are you talking about?
who did this?
come with me.
i can't do it without you.
yeah, you can.
we'll meet again.
there's something i want you to remember.
all the things that i said about us.
i meant them with all my heart.
so no matter what happens he fired before he acquired the target, gave away his position, and that was the end of him.
so don't let this happen to you.
during this exercise, we could have six or eight ships hitting the merge where the fight starts.
so keep your head on a swivel, especially in the vertical.
oh, my gods, athena.
okay, okay. in the locker room.
it was boomer.
did she get hera?
six, get a med team in here right frakking now.
k- ro, get on the horn to cic and let 'em know boomer's loose.
she's got my frakking kid! lso, athena, what's the delay with my flight clearance?
uh, please hold, raptor 719.
looks like we're still waiting for traffic to clear your flight path.
stand by for instructions.
come on.
she's not buying it, sir.
she initiated prestart.
boomer, this is galactica actual.
return to checkers red and shut down.
copy.
hoshi.
vector the cap to intercept.
blue leader, galactica.
immediate.
proceed directly to galactica.
engage raptor two-one-niner.
weapons free.
blue flight, rolling in hot.
if you launch, boomer, i will shoot you down.
i don't think you wanna do that while i have hera on board.
we can't let her get off this ship.
retract the flight pods.
sir, she's spooling to jump.
if she jumps inside the ship, the spatial disruption could tear galactica's guts out.
retract the flight pods.
retract flight pods.
i say again, retract flight pods.
don't do it.
don't do it!
don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!
frak! hera.
i need a team, scaffolding, shoring compound to the forward magazine right away! but one eight looks like another.
how did a three-year old girl get by you, though? the hell's going on up there?
boomer took her kid.
what kind of answer is that?
what?
she took hera and just walked right out of the daycare.
how the hell do you let a three-year old girl climb into a raptor?
how did she get by you? i'm sorry, sir, but nobody saw your daughter.
that's impossible!
somebody saw her! she's a three-year old child.
explain to me how she gets by had to be orchestrated from the beginning.
my escape, all of it.
i was just a means to get boomer here.
cavil wanted hera.
boomer got her for him.
how can a three-year old girl spontaneously write down that song?
she's plugged into something that's manipulating all of us.
maybe anders could help us.
if he ever wakes up.
previously, on battlestar galactica there are survivors on caprica.
a resistance movement.
we've been fighting the cylons.
hitting them where we can.
now it looks like they're here to stay.
they're rebuilding caprica.
the first sharon was a sleeper agent.
didn't realize she was a cylon until her programming kicked in.
i'm sharon, but i'm a different sharon, and i'm here to help.
now i've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.
so i'm only in your head i'm pregnant, helo.
we're gonna have a child.
sharon is going to bear our child.
an honor for which she is hardly deserving.
but one doesn't question god's will.
cylons reincarnate.
it makes sense, doesn't it all our memories are downloaded into a brand-new body.
we're as good as new.
death becomes a learning experience.
wait, there has to be another way out of here.
i mean you must have an escape plan.
you're not about to be destroyed by your own bombs, are you how are you leaving gaius, i can't die.
when this body's destroyed, my memory, my consciousness will be transmitted to a new one.
i'll just wake up somewhere else in an identical body.
you mean there's more out there like you there are 12 models.
i'm number 6. i don't want to die.
get down.
do you love me where-- i was in a house.
but you're not in a house any longer.
you're back with us.
you've been reborn.
i died.
i died.
that's right.
you were in a house.
it was destroyed.
a nuclear blast.
but that is all over now.
you have been downloaded into a new body.
gaius.
gaius was in the house.
gaius baltar yes. is he alive is he i'm not really here.
no one can see me but you.
don't let them know.
six.
would it trouble you if doctor baltar were dead if they know how you feel about me, it'll be a problem. it would be unfortunate if he died.
he was so helpful.
very helpful.
your mission was a resounding success.
it completely disabled the colonial defenses.
the attack succeeded beyond our most optimistic projections, thanks to you.
you're a machine, i'm not.
i know there's pain, but breathe.
ride through it.
you're going to be okay.
trust me.
you're in god's hands.
we're all here with you.
that's it.
this will pass.
trust me.
everything's gonna be all right.
welcome home, little sister.
we're here.
we're going to take care of you.
we're proud of you, sharon.
and we love you.
episode 18 season 'downloaded' i was thinking it symbolized rebirth, a new beginning.
it's a memorial.
do you know how many people died in this park during the attack how many people in this park alone it's gonna be lovely, isn't it sorry.
a new place to relax, collect your thoughts.
how you doing i'm a little stiff.
i'm still trying to get used to this body.
i mean, i know it's identical, but even after all this time, i still feel awkward.
i was a klutz too.
always knock things over.
forever trip over things and you know what you get over it.
and you know what, this is a great chance to cleanse.
you got a new body, a new life.
and anything that you've built up like anxieties or remorse or guilt, just let it wash away.
i can't tell you how thankful i am.
you've been a really big help to me.
no, it's me who's thankful.
we all are.
you are a war hero.
we could not have won without you.
excuse me.
i just wanted to say it's an honor to have you here on caprica with us.
what you did well, it's inspiring.
thank you. how you doing freezing.
i can't feel my legs.
that's the epidural.
what happened you passed out and started bleeding again, but everything's gonna be all right.
like hell it is.
i find it absolutely amazing.
you people went to all the trouble to appear human and didn't upgrade the plumbing.
you have a detached placenta.
baby has to come out now or we could lose you both.
i'm gonna to have to ask you to step back, please.
she's tachycardiac, and her blood pressure's drop.
she's hemorrhaging again.
we're gonna to have to make the cut now.
sharon, can you hear me helo.
still can't get used to this.
well, you're a hero of the cylons now.
you're our first celebrity.
no, i'm just another six.
you're too modest.
i'm just another three.
and they're fives and-- or eights.
but you, everyone calls you caprica six.
like you're the only six on the planet.
and what you did was incredibly difficult.
seduce a man, so emotionally and physically so that he grants you access to all the most closely ed secrets of his people.
i mean, that mission could be profoundly disturbing.
disturbing she means slee with me or killing billions of people ?'cause i'd rather thought it was difficult at times.
see, nobody here can possibly understand what you've been through, which is why we need your help.
there's another cylon who's been having trouble re-integrating after a download.
another hero, actually.
an eight.
still insists on calling herself sharon.
and you thought i could help.
i'm still having i'm having problems of my own.
caprica, you don't understand.
she really needs your help.
if we don't turn her around soon, there's talk of boxing her.
putting her memories in cold storage you can't be serious.
that's a charming way to deal with emotional problems.
one might almost call it inhuman.
that's right, you are.
all right, look, it is a last resort, but she has been regressing.
please.
she's living up there in that apartment.
it's the one she had when security's minimal.
two centurions patrol out front. the third bullet-head watch the perimeter.
bullet-head walking perimeter makes random changes to his patrol.
be tough to get past him.
all right, so we go under him.
the storm drain leads directly to the garage underneath the cafe.
they'll be dozens of skin jobs inside.
she's not breathing.
suction it.
right away.
what's going on where are you taking her her lungs aren't fully developed.
she needs oxygen support.
but she's alive, right right there's your answer.
now you get the hell out of here.
we have to stop the mother bleeding or you here to kick me out no. you're here to help me with my adjustment problems.
i could save you some time.
this is home.
i'm not leaving.
i lived on caprica for two years.
i knew what i was.
pretended to be human, but i knew.
if you knew what you were and you lived on caprica, you know what that makes you.
a really good liar.
start with the elephants.
these are beautiful.
ithacan hand-carved.
my mother gave them to me the day i left for the fleet academy. is this her supposed to be.
'course none of it's real.
all fabricated for my mission.
it's all a lie.
following god's path is never easy.
don't get religious with this one.
what are you thinking do you think i care about your god look, god loves you.
this is love.
these people love me.
i love them.
i didn't pretend to feel something so i could screw people over.
i love them.
and then i betrayed them.
i shot a man i love.
fracked over another man, ruined his life.
and why ?. because i'm a lying machine.
i'm a fracking cylon.
sorry.
i didn't mean to i've got bandages in there.
nicely done.
you timed it perfectly.
scratch your face with the side of your fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.
never saw a cylon show fear before.
especially the sixes.
usually so hardcore.
feign fear and emotional vulnerability.
you're very good, you know.
but i'm better.
let me help you.
'i'm different.'
i'm different.
'i'm more like you.' i'm more like you.
i had someone i met here.
a man.
i loved him and i think he could've loved me eventually.
half a cigarette should give us or any longer and we risk them finding the charges before they go off. is it two minutes or three about to find out.
this is a risky operation just to nail a couple dozen skin jobs.
we can't kill'em.
they'll just download into a new body and i mean, what's the point that skin job with starbuck, 'sharon' they called her. she said that when they download, they remember everything.
right up until the end.
these skin jobs are gonna remember being blown into tiny little pieces.
it's gotta hurt.
yeah.
i hope it hurts a lot.
because sooner or later, the message sinks in.
there is no safe place, not even a cafe.
so if you want to quit living through hell and dying over and over again, then get the frack off our planet.
three minutes, ten seconds.
boom.
this house was on a bluff over a lake.
always loved the view.
sunlight on the water.
it's my favorite spot in the universe.
yeah, it's magical.
too bad you nuked it.
after i downloaded, i went back to the ruins of his house.
why like you, i was looking for some sort of connection to him.
found a few of his things.
even held onto them for awhile.
but, i realized they were kee me from truly embracing my new life.
so what'd you do with them i burned them.
but i felt liberated.
yeah, it's a beautiful story, isn't it shame it's all a pack of lies.
so who was he this man you loved.
maybe you've heard of him.
gaius baltar.
doctor baltar yeah. he gave you access to the colonial defense grid. he was the one who betrayed us 'us.' oh, i love it.
this one thinks she's more human than cylon.
just like someone else i know.
does he still work for the cylons - what on galactica he's alive he's the vice-president of the colonies.
you didn't know that if their baby does survive, the question is what do we do with it do what are you suggesting that we throw it out of an air lock i don't make suggestions, mr.
baltar.
if i want to toss a baby out an air lock, i'd say so.
it's really gratifying to know that infanticide's not on the table.
do i have to point out that this is not a baby it's a machine.
no, it's half machine, half human.
i suggest we all keep that half in mind.
cylons went through a great deal of trouble to create this thing.
should go without saying that if it's good for them, it's gonna be bad for us.
i completely agree.
and i take it as a given we can't turn it over to sharon to raise.
that would be disastrous.
there's still another factor to consider here.
there's cylons aboard this fleet.
if they find out this thing's been born, they're gonna make a play for it.
you can see where this is headed, gaius.
we're gonna have to take our child.
hello, hera.
she's got quite a grip on her.
you don't like it in there, do you, hera you gotta stay in till your lungs get stronger.
she's our little girl.
we made her. it almost makes you want to believe in the cylon god.
almost.
i love you so completely.
it's clear.
here, take this.
let's move.
here you go.
why do you think they kept it from you is the wrong question.
the right question is why did she get me to work with you knowing she knew i had feelings for gaius.
knew that i had trouble letting go of him.
she must've known it would trigger those feelings and those memories.
she's fracking with you.
can't you see that - but why it's so perfectly obvious.
you know, for a self-aware cybernetic life-form, sometimes you can be oh for god sake.
careful.
everything okay fine.
just talking with sharon here.
yeah what about she asked me to move out.
you know what which is what we've been asking her for weeks.
i was kind of ho that you'd see the light after talking to our friend here.
she is lying, unfortunately.
she has no wish to see sharon cured.
they're just gonna do it.
they're going to box her.
how many cylons up in the cafe full house.
at least 40.
three minutes, ten seconds.
we've just made a breakthrough.
she's agreed to move out of her apartment.
didn't you, sharon yeah.
i'm moving out of the apartment.
when whenever.
what about now i'll help.
the apartment is right upstairs.
sure.
let me let me just get some things.
good work six, must've been some chat.
yes, we had a lot to talk about.
she's right behind you.
i know.
this is not a debate.
this child will not be raised by the cylon, and i can not risk cylon agents getting their hands on it, i've made my decision.
what i need from you, doctor, is your help.
fine, i don't like it, but have it your way.
i need it immediately.
we'll have to find somebody suitable.
i'll have to work up a list of names.
each of them is capable, each of them is anonymous and each can be trusted.
thought of everything, haven't you i hope so.
are you all right, sharon what happened an .
building came down on us.
looks like the stairwell saved us.
where's six her body's dead.
no, not yet.
help me out here.
would've been better if the  had killed her.
there's nothing we can do about the pain until we get her out of here.
hey, six.
i can get a cross beam and put you out of your misery.
i'm not gonna give up on life again.
it's your choice.
where the heck are we anyway must be in the garage.
north entrance must be that way.
i'm gonna start digging.
hang in there.
you're gonna be okay.
we have a survivor.
yeah.
hang on, buddy.
we'll get you out.
fresh air coming from down there.
thanks.
i though i was a goner.
frackin'human.
you know he probably set that .
what, for the resistance why no military value to the cafe.
but humans don't respect life the way we do.
no.
i won't let you kill him.
she's right.
don't kill him.
why not why not kill him you've already killed billions of people.
do you honestly believe one more body is gonna weigh any heavier on your conscience, which is something that you don't have, do you we should interrogate him.
find his accomplices.
okay.
you can let go now, sharon.
what's this looks like colonial fleet id.
thrace, kara.
starbuck - she was on caprica a couple of weeks ago.
she escaped with the help of another sharon.
if she gave him this, he meant something to her. well, then it's sweet.
you have it in your hand.
hard physical proof of one person's love for another.
if only you felt this deeply about us.
i did.
i do.
i love you, gaius.
where's the tangible proof i don't understand.
she was doing so well.
no, she wasn't.
i tried to tell you that.
her lungs were never fully developed.
she finally went into respiratory distress, we couldn't get her intubated in time and we lost her.
i'm sorry.
i should've been here.
sharon.
listen, you've lost a lot of blood.
you murdered her.
sharon, come on.
who ordered it adama the president who i don't kill patients.
we did the best we could, but she's dead and that's all there is to it.
i should be able to release the ashes to you in a few hours.
murderer.
sharon.
die.
you're all murderers.
stay back.
you're all murderers.
get her out of here.
give me my baby.
you let them murder our child.
i am so sorry.
i tried, i tried my best.
god's will was that our child should survive.
his will was that she would lead the next generation of god's children.
his will was that you would protect her.
yes.
you have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin and now you and your entire wretched race are going to suffer god's vengeance.
she's so beautiful.
i don't know how to thank you. when i lost my baby, i didn't know how i could go on.
well, i'm glad things worked out for you and this little girl.
i can't believe somebody would give up this little angel.
you understand, maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy.
the mother is a pegasus officer and must remain anonymous for political and religious reasons.
you have my word.
maya, you won't mind if i drop in occasionally. of course not.
good.
go.
thank you. i know how awful this was for you but trust me, it was imperative.
as far as the cylons know, this child no longer exists.
that is a good, good thing.
is this what you're looking for you can have it.
here.
what are you doing just making it easy for him to get what he wants.
come on, i'll give you a head start.
i'm fine where i am.
hey, they're coming for us.
and you.
they'll be very interested in you.
leave him alone.
sharon you're a hero of the cylons.
now you're just a broken machine who thinks she's a human.
but you're not a human, sharon, and you never will be.
yeah, well at least i'm not a murderer.
i have a conscience.
and i know the difference between right and wrong.
a murderer is exactly what you are.
life is short.
but the next one's not.
let your heart adrift and your soul will get caught.
i love you, gaius.
my heart and soul are yours.
they're nearly here.
you know why they wanted you to work with sharon so you'd lose your mind.
they're gonna box you, darling, just like they're gonna box sharon.
we're dangerous.
what - sharon and i. we're celebrities in a culture based on unity.
no.
our voices count.
more than hers, more than others'.
two heroes of the cylons, right two heroes with different perspectives on the war.
perspectives based on our love of two human beings.
that's why she wanted me to work with you so that you'd tell me that gaius was still alive.
she wanted me to lose my mind.
no, you're corrupted by your experiences.
you're a waste.
believe the lies.
ignore the truth, listen to me, i will show you the proof.
speak from your heart.
say the things that you know to be true.
jealously, murder, vengeance, they're all sins in the eyes of god.
that's what you and i know.
that's what they don't want to hear.
because then they'd have to rethink what they're doing.
they'd have to consider that maybe the slaughter of mankind was a mistake.
god loves me.
see you again soon.
looks like they're almost here.
you should get out of here while you can. the fresh air coming in might lead you out. is this some kind of trick you can stay and be tortured if you want.
your call.
who are you what kind of people are you i don't know.
hey, wait.
how long till she downloads and tells them what happened we had a lot of people in the cafe.
at least 36 hours till they get to her. long enough.
long enough for what to change things for the better.
what are you talking about i have never loved anyone more in my life than i love you now.
our people need a new beginning.
a new way to live in god's love.
without hate, without all the lies.
all they need is for someone to show them the way.
someone like two heroes of the cylons.
i'm with you.
we found them.
they're alive.
yes, we are.
we're alive.
previously on battlestar galactica.
why don't you do yourself a favor?
hand over your book: my triumphs, my mistakes by gaius baltar.
the people are reading it, and now you're sorry.
baltar will get his trial, and this is what you'll get. a hurricane, you will have sectarian violence.
you will have assassination attempts.
you will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen.
president wants to take the fast track on baltar's trial.
she's looking for someone to take charge in the preliminaries.
help cobble together the legal framework.
she wants me to assign you.
these were my grandfather's law books.
it's from your father.
starbuck, apollo, i've lost you on dradis!
no! lee, we're sending in the search and rescue birds right now.
we'll find her.
no, dad, it's no use.
her ship's in pieces.
we lost her.
here's every captain from every ship in the fleet.
captain elias meeker, gideon.
and the last name for the tribunal is yeah.
yeah, i see the resemblance.
one more for heads.
watch.
heads!
did you see that? four in a row.
it's a frakkin' miracle.
watch this, one more time.
it's gonna be heads.
watch.
heads!
every time, you see that? it's heads.
why don't you come down from there?
i'm just fine right here, man.
major?
yeah?
heads!
you see that? my girl's too lucky to check out.
hey, sam.
lee.
apollo.
just stay there, buddy.
you're flying.
let's just get down and get some sleep.
come on.
i-i'm fine, i'm just gonna sit down.
you all right?
she wasn't supposed to it wasn't come on, sam.
no, i gotta go.
frak! frak. is he okay?
ahi think i fell.
sam.
sam.
she's still alive, right?
no, she's gone, sam.
she's gone.
i know.
lso, viper 6. request long approach.
viper 6, lso.
approved.
i never thought i'd miss all starbuck's yakking.
yes, sir.
your honor.
you haven't heard.
where you been? they just announced it.
you won the lottery.
you now own exactly 1/5 of baltar's skinny ass.
you're one of five captains picked to serve on the judge's tribunal.
here he comes.
frak.
what a waste of my time and energy flying baltar's lawyer back and forth from zephyr.
yeah, tell me about it.
wanna know what the worst part is? he sits back there and tries to whisper into my ear when he talks.
i've got a helmet.
sorry.
mr.
hughes.
he takes his shoes off in my raptor again, i might have to kill him.
client.
everybody knows he's guilty.
he gave the cylons our location.
why even give the son of a bitch a trial?
because he's entitled.
even him, it's called justice.
yeah, right.
see, baltar dead starbuck alive, that'd be justice.
there's no justice.
drunk as he was racetrack!
racetrack, are you okay? medic!
i got him, i got him.
okay. is he okay?
battlestar galactica season - episode 18  the son also rises  thanks, insults, critics transcript lama, lovechange, nikomagnus = lords of kobol - madam president! how do you intend to replace gaius baltar's defense attorney?
will that be done by lottery as well?
we're confident we'll replace him shortly.
there's a number of candidates.
we're working our way down the list.
next.
madam president! karen.
taken in the context of this , which obviously was no accident, you think it's in the best interest of the fleet to proceed with this trial?
this administration will never bow to terrorism.
wait, you know, let me say something here to all of you.
let me get this clear, all right?
as long as i am president, this administration will not allow terrorism to alter the framework of our legal system.
we will proceed with the trial, rigorously.
thank you, all of you.
one more question!
helo, i need you to set up a dradis picket with blue squadron in sector seven.
excuse me, sir.
you mean sector nine, right?
right.
right, nine.
yeah, we scrubbed eight on the last picket.
it's been so quiet, one pick just flows into the next.
okay, uh 81 carom, 22 degrees.
keep your ears open.
any cylon contact, just shut down, bug out.
red squadron, you'll be riding first cap with me.
and, from here on, double shifts.
athena, i'm going to need you exclusively on shuttle runs.
yeah, don't forget to check under your back seat.
you got lucky, starbuck.
if i were you, i would seriously consider buying a-- racetrack, i'm sorry.
dismissed.
dismissed.
well, it's so comforting to know that you're not afraid.
you're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive.
the question is why? for the fame, the glory.
you worked in the public litigation office on caprica.
you think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude?
i was born for this.
that and the fact that i have a pulse.
lance belonged to my wife.
don't worry.
he doesn't scratch or bite like she did.
if it's of any comfort, i despise him as much as you do having to hire me.
so there it is.
shall we get started?
i'm gonna need you to handle the security detail on the new attorney.
me? so that's it, you're grounding me.
then you're the only one i can trust.
you know, just say it.
you're pulling me.
kee lampkin alive is an important job.
i need your help.
dad, i'm fine.
no, you're not.
why? because i'm not.
yeah?
well, then maybe you should take a rest.
helo'll be step in as cag.
i want you on this ship.
not up there.
not until you can work this out.
right.
i understand.
work it out.
okay.
i'll be handling security for you.
where do you want your bags?
you'll have two marines stationed outside the door.
ms.
cassidy, the prosecuting attorney, is just down the hall.
there's a head, showers that way.
sorry, coed.
now, if there's anything else? i'd like to see my client.
now? pilot.
yeah.
king of the pilots.
we could stand around here and discuss why you got stuck with me, if you want.
i'll take you to his cell.
no, no, not there.
half the ship's probably listening in.
fine, whatever, we have an interrogation room.
interrogation rooms give me stage fright.
i can't bring him here.
i was thinking your quarters.
what?
yeah, before it gets wired for sound like this place probably is.
what's the problem?
forgot to make your bed? look, i don't care where you see him.
i just can't leave you alone.
major.
it is major, isn't it?
i have a right to consult with my client in private, without anybody eavesdrop or looking in.
whoever cares the most wins.
says so in there.
so? i wanna see my client, you don't care.
i win.
you know, you look like him.
you knew my grandfather.
hated his guts. he taught me everything i know.
what are you doing here anyway?
you can speak freely.
he signed confidentiality papers.
look, this whole charade's pathetic.
pathetic!
security?
security's already toasting my other attorney's untimely demise.
about the only thing that bloke ever did apart from nap, was manage to smuggle out my papers.
papers.
do you have any papers?
thank you. the nature of modern life is obsession.
so tell me do you honestly think that i'm gonna get a fair trial?
doubtful.
yes.
but you haven't exactly been hel yourself, now, have you?
you object to my writing.
on the contrary, keep it coming.
this new manifesto of yours shows a great change in you.
this little operating manual of yours.
well, keeps them all guessing.
okay.
caprica 6. i'm worried about her. she's the key.
they can use her to completely destroy me.
we need to get to her. we need to know what she's thinking.
we need to i need to talk to her. tell her tell her that i love her very much.
and i'm thinking about her a lot.
i can sense that, yes.
you need to find out where we're all standing.
to listen requires a voice.
for what needs to be known, requires us to ask.
my triumphs, my mistakes, by gaius baltar.
but you say it very well.
i've done my reading.
once those papers arrive, i suggest you do yours.
fly me to colonial one.
me? yeah, you're a pilot, aren't you?
you can't just jump in a raptor.
these things have to be coordinated.
where would you rather be, major?
here, as the parade float for the bereaved?
what are you talking about?
everybody looking at you like you're bleeding out of your side.
you wanna see some real blood?
keep going.
oh, there is someone home.
look, i need those files.
you come with me, they might just give them to me.
i wait, they're gonna discover that baltar's pregnant before i get them.
what is your job anyway?
keep me alive, or keep me from doing mine?
sorry, sir, you know your status.
you're to remain shipside.
those are admiral's orders.
father factor.
come on, kelly, give me a break.
i'm along for the ride.
don't do this to me.
all right?
i'm in enough dung already.
all right.
all right, let's get the bird a tow! hold up, open the door, open the door!
what the frak was that thing?
did you see that? what?
i think it was a cat! that's my cat! there's a frakkin' cat in there!
come on out of there, major.
who the hell let a cat in here?
he's on the other side, push him over here.
there it is!
it's over there!
it's over there!
there it is.
there it is.
kitty, kitty!
no, no, come here!
come here.
come here.
bomb! bomb! everybody out! what the hell were you doing out there? i gave you an order to do a job.
excuse me, i was doing my job.
yeah, being led around by the nose?
this bastard yanked your chain, and you jump? he wanted files from colonial one.
it was the middle of the night.
you assigned me to security.
yeah, and there was a bomb on that ship.
and you missed it.
security?
i gave you explicit orders.
athena was piloting.
you could've died.
plain and simple.
you're a soldier.
live like one.
start acting like one.
she's been gone two weeks.
i didn't realize the clock's running.
stop.
no, i'm sorry, maybe we're just built differently.
you stop.
don't you dare quantify my loss.
you have no idea.
you have no frakking idea!
what, you think yours is deeper?
well.
yours is greater? in two weeks, there's going to be a trial!
and i'm gonna do what i was chosen to do and so are you!
you build a frakkin' nest around this man.
and you protect his ass.
frakker meant business this time.
that thing had gone off, we'd be picking up raptor and people parts with tweezers.
every day i wave jocks out there. a lot of them are my friends.
people i care for and love.
it's hard enough watching them die in battle.
but rickshawing baltar's frakkin' attorney around?
frak that.
i believe the cylons want us to destroy ourselves and this is how they're doing it.
by planting bombs, making us suspicious of each other.
you know what's funny?
by the time the cylons catch up with us, they won't even have to attack.
they'll just clean up the mess we made.
i think they're here.
i think you're wrong.
all i know is i kissed nicky this morning, it could've been the last time.
cally, that's enough.
what?
i kissed you too! some of us don't get a second chance.
or a third.
i'm going to the admiral.
all right, take a good look at this room.
every time you leave, memorize it.
if anything changes, don't touch it.
a book moves, shoes in the wrong place, something smells different, you get the frak out.
someone knocks, don't answer the door.
don't open the door!
look, you have to do what i say.
if they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.
now, who do i have to bribe to see the cylon woman? the nature of modern life is obsession.
damn, i can't find my glasses.
it's like they've got feet.
the six.
yes, okay.
lampkin can interview six immediately, as long as it's conducted under the same conditions accorded to the chief prosecutor.
all right?
meaning in the interrogation room.
not where you sleep. of course, but since you've been selected to serve on the tribunal, i'm assuming you won't be at those interviews, in the interest of fairness.
major has a point, bill.
major's mistaken.
i monitored the chief prosecutor's interview.
therefore, same conditions apply. in the interest of fairness.
mr.
lampkin is still entitled to those documents that he requested from colonial one.
yes, right, i apologize.
we've had trouble locating the files.
we'll have 'em delivered to you on the next run?
i'm sorry, major, we'll get them to you right away, thank you. thank you. i understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.
gaius baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being.
in the time i've known him, he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception.
he was narcissistic, self-centered, feckless, and vain.
i'm the one who should have stabbed him.
things are looking up.
love.
precocious evolutionary move, fashioning cylons to be capable of experiencing it.
i don't know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative, but it's not for the faint-hearted, is it?
no, it's not.
maybe you should've been nicer to your mechanic.
perhaps cylon love is not the same as human love.
perhaps it's designed to hurt a little less.
how would you know?
i loved a woman.
beautiful, beautiful woman.
but so serious.
this frowning face trapped in the middle of a daisy.
she had a way of walking processional.
as if she were on her way to her own execution.
we had ten years.
then it fell apart under its own weight.
is that what you wanted?
i thought if i could get over her, i could get over anything.
i could endure, conquer, be a man, stand up to any and all kind of punishment.
i clung to an empty, spinning bed for months.
and that that is when i finally realized how much i loved her. if i needed all that strength what was the point?
i needed to be with her. did he ask about me? gaius? he wanted to know if you were well. he wanted you to know that he misses you.
loves you.
because he can't be here to tell you he gave me this to give to you. he uses that at the risk of grave reprisal to express his feelings to put his world into some kind of recognizable order.
to be heard.
he's kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another.
he wants you to have it.
because without you it has no meaning.
he wants you to have it because he would do anything, anything, to be with you again.
well, that's a shame, isn't it?
since they'll never let me keep it.
you understand that your days are owned and tallied by these people, the ones out there watching us.
i think you realize what's likely to become of you.
i couldn't help you if they paid me ten times what they offered me for baltar.
you won't get a trial.
not even a bad one.
so i have to ask you.
does your love hurt as much as mine?
yes.
i feel like part of our world just fell down.
hey, guys.
yes, sir.
why encourage the man to write, and then take his pen? he'll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that he's been silenced.
tyranny, gag orders.
very sexy.
allright.
so you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the six. the horror of the age.
the great ugly material.
the cloak of deceit.
the truth.
kind of overrated, i guess.
you know, when i was nine, maybe ten, my grandfather he would wave me over.
and he'd do this all the time.
and then he'd say, be a good boy.
just don't be too good.
everybody has demons.
them, baltar, you, me.
even the machines.
the law is just a way of exorcising them.
that's what your father's father taught me.
you want to know why i hated him?
because he was right.
you hated him because he was right, and i hated the law because it was wrong.
because of what of what it put him through.
i mean, he defended the worst of worst.
i remember reading about him.
the outrage.
hel murders go free.
what i don't understand is why he put himself through all that abuse.
you think he gave a flying frak?
joe adama cared about one thing.
understanding why people do what they do.
why we cheat our friends.
why we reward our enemies.
why we go to war.
sacrificing our lives for lost causes.
why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and our shortcomings.
why we forgive, defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion.
we're flawed.
all of us.
i wanted to know why.
so i did what he did.
i spend my life with the fallen.
the corrupt.
the damaged.
look at you.
you were so ready to go on that raptor with me.
be the bad boy, the prodigal son.
no, i was doing my job protecting you.
what are you doing in my business?
suddenly i'm handcuffed to a serial contrarian.
no, i am not look, okay.
my bed is made.
i suggest you toil on your own.
now, this cross-examination is over, i'd like to take a crap.
romo, that story that you told about the girl, the woman that you loved and getting over her. is it true?
was it true?
yes.
for him.
files from colonial one.
finally.
i thought i'd get all these after the trial was over.
hold it.
put that on the floor now.
for frak's sake.
i was there when kelly x-rayed 'em.
it's papers.
here you go.
good? it looks good.
no! you have five minutes, major.
thank you. before the hounds got to it.
open.
the president's glasses.
she looks better without them.
less serious.
serious catches on in the courtroom.
your father's.
when? from the deck.
right after you found the bomb underneath the raptor.
here, kitty, kitty.
it was hanging by a thread.
they tarnish so fast.
it was like that when i plucked it.
everybody else tigh, the others you all shiny.
the soldier in him has had enough for a while.
he'll be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there.
miss prosecuting attorney down the hall.
it's not what you think.
it was appropriated with the noblest of intentions.
see that the soles.
see how the soles are worn.
she drags her feet.
you're catching on.
and the rest?
what's all this?
my demons.
i borrow things.
my parents disappeared when i was nine years old.
they were kidnapped.
murdered for for the money they had on them which wasn't enough.
i went to live with an uncle, stole from him until i could run away.
so what did you take from me? i was thinking the photograph that you carry.
the girl.
the pilot.
the one you're carrying.
but you've had enough stolen from you already.
i'll try and get these back to her somehow.
the other pocket at the back.
the s took it from her. i borrowed it from them.
we still have a case pending.
if you want to help if you dare to help get this to my client.
a case?
i have a calling.
it's all the ringing in my ears tells me.
okay, you better explain this.
i don't even know what it is.
well, i do.
where did you get it?
the one that scolded you like a schoolboy.
frakking with your head.
what's-his-name, mr.
serious?
kelly.
kel-kelly?
i never would've let athena go airborne with you on the raptor.
i would've stopped it.
you know that.
yeah, i know that.
you better lock me up.
and i don't want any trial.
i won't stop.
i will keep trying.
i'll keep at it, i will.
i did my job, sir.
and i have done my job for two years now.
every day i sent people out to fight.
i cleared them all to die.
so many people.
i just got tired of living with that.
you ask that man if you had to choose between giving his life up for a cylon or a human, what do you think he'd say? i had to do something.
xo reinstate major adama as commander of the air group.
effective immediately.
it's good to have you back.
thank you. i'm sorry.
because i was wrong, and i made it worse no.
you know, you should be in your bird-- i think i should be with lampkin.
now that we know that it was kelly, we can ease up a little on security.
in his condition, lampkin needs help preparing the trial, presenting his case.
the president has a few possibilities.
she's looking.
dad, why not me?
i'm close to the case.
i've read the documents.
i understand lampkin's strategy-- we have things under control.
lampkin will have help.
i want to do this.
you're a cag.
you're not a lawyer.
far from it.
what, and you're a judge?
no, but like the four other men picked, i'm capable of listening to the evidence and making an ethical decision.
and i'm capable of hel lampkin.
forget it.
i need you as cag.
why did you give me those books, huh? i mean, you gave me your father's law books.
i made a mistake.
why? why is it a mistake?
are you afraid that i'll be like him?
you're a pilot.
and with zak gone, and kara gone, you need someone to carry the flag, is that it?
you're a pilot and you're my son.
and i will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side.
see me? or see someone else? report for duty. is that an order?
you're in way over your head.
report for duty. is that an order?
i'm through giving you orders.
remove apollo from the board.
inform helo he's to remain a cag.
my son has more important things to attend to.
hey, how's the leg? you mean my lucky break? it gave me a reason not to come up here.
sooner or later, you run out of excuses.
it's hard to let her go.
lee i'll see you around.
there is no greater ally, no force more powerful, no enemy more resolved than a son who chooses to step from his father's shadow.
romo lampkin.
previously on battlestar galactica what am i? a ghost, a demon?
you are asking the wrong guy.
i'm just a piano player.
is that for me? yeah.
holy crap.
sam! there's a lot still going on in there.
and there is nothing to indicate that he's having any kind of conscious thought.
what if we could link him to a data stream like our hybrids?
we have to figure out a contingency plan for the ship, now.
you have to face the fact that you will lose her.
boomer's loose.
she's got my frakking kid! k- ro, get on the cic and warn the admiral.
sir, boomer's spooling to jump.
if she jumps inside the ship, the spatial disruption could tear galactica's guts out.
hey.
hey! what have you been bitching about?
it's not our fault that the resins wont bond with these inferior alloys. in other words it's our fault that this scoop of yours is doing crap except making this place smell like the inside of a latrine.
really?
i thought that was you! lady you work on your side and i'll work on mine.
whoa! whoa! whoa! come on!
come on!
not with this guy!
not now!
stop your bitching!
not now.
fine, fine!
let's go! if john's plan all along was to steal hera so he could study her study her? they gonna dissect her like a frakking lab rat, we all know it.
if he wants to try to determine what made her a successful human/cylon hybrid he'll take her to the colony.
the colony?
i guess you could call a home.
it's where we and centurions went after the first war, once we convinced them to abandoned their own experiments with evolutions, in exchange for resurrection technology.
she knows where it is.
so, you would have the galactica jump into a cylon hornet nest, risk everything for one solitary single child.
is that what you're telling me colonel?
she's not just any child.
with caprica six's miscarriage, hera is our people's only hope of avoiding eventual extinction.
she may be our only hope too.
i just think we just experienced something remarkable.
hera wrote the notes to a song.
a song that my father used to play to me when i was a child.
same song that switched us on when we were in that nebula.
same song that led us to earth.
something is happening here, something that is greater that all of us, and that little girl is in the middle of it.
she's the key, sir. in other words, it's our destiny to go after her, right?
wrong!
i'm fed up to here with destiny with prophecy, with god or the gods.
look where it's left yes, and to nowhere.
nearly half of our people are gone.
earth, worthless cinder and i can't even walk down the halls of my ship without wondering if i only catch a bullet for getting us into this mess.
we're alive, bill.
four years ago i wouldn't have taken odds on that.
at least he was a recon bird.
we can see what we're up against.
make it a heavy raider.
i don't want helo and athena to find out about this.
look at me. look at me. look at me. you hate me, don't you? say it.
say it.
god's frakking damn! hera?
hera! hera! bill, i've been having that dream again.
help me!
take it!
take it!
grab the door!
lock it!
lock it!
battlestar galactica season episode 18 islanded in a stream of stars original file by italian subs addicted thanks to you all! enjoy!
we've got an internal bleeding, doc.
taking her to surgery.
right.
i hope we don't lose power.
what's the telling?
leoben was calling it the proverbial straw.
sir, we got five more jump's max.
after that there is a 90% chance of tearing her in half.
i don't want to hear that you are 90 percent sure of anything.
you come back when you are 100 percent sure, you got that?
go take care of the injuries.
yes, sir.
that frakking cylon rep, sonja, wanted to know when you'll be transferring your flag.
transferring to where?
her base ship?
that'll be the frakking day.
that's exactly what i said.
i'll get on top of this repair detail.
we'll straighten it up.
it must be tough to say goodbye to both of your women at once.
you must feel like we're abandoning you.
and neither one of my women are dying.
they just need a bit more of care and attention.
hera.
admiral adama will be forced to abandon galactica.
yes.
and at which point the cylon base ship fleet captain's meeting 1750 hours will be our sole means of defense?
under the admiral's command augmented by galactica's pilots, planes, and the military personnel, as it is always been.
mister adama, it sure seems that you are putting a lot of power into the hands of some people.
and i use the term loosely that not so long ago they were doing their damnest to wipe us out.
and your concerns are noted.
as you all know as.. let me speak.
as you all know we agreed to accept admiral adama's military authority in return for a seat on this council.
we intend to abide by that promise.
speaking of promises i have been complaining about air quality aboard hitei khan from day one.
i am submitting my requisition now for galactica's co2 and particulate scrubbers.
excuse me? as long as we get the ftls.
our last emergency jump took minutes to spin up.
wait.
wait a minute.
obviously we will have to do a complete inventory of galactica's equipment.
maybe even a lottery, in order to ensure a appropriable distribution of all the equipment.
listen to me for one goddamn minute.
no one removes so much as one botfrom this battlestar not until the admiral tells us we can.
really?
what does gaius baltar say about that?
gaius baltar?
angels.
angels, i hear you say.
i don't believe that angels appear to you in some mystical spectral form.
angels take the guise of those who are nearest and dearest of you, those who can understand our doubts and your trials and steer you back on the road to salvation.
i believe in these angels because i see them.
wherever you are in the fleet this is gaius baltar, wishing you a good day.
excuse me, caprica.
caprica 6! erm, erm, it's good to listen, i heard about your loss and i want to offer you my condolences, tell you i'm truly sorry, i am! thank you, gaius.
i see i've got your you know, if you need any more we've got so much i'm fine and also, i'm not aware of your current situation, but if you need a place to stay i've no desire to join your harem.
no, no.
that's not what i that's not what we are trying to make a difference within the fleet.
you haven't changed, gaius.
not really.
i have.
colonel.
colonel.
she wants to talk to you.
me? she is dying.
could you just take a few minutes out of your busy schedule and be with her? thank you thank me? for what? for the privilege of finally being able to meet my father before i die.
you shouldn't be thanking be.
i spent most of my life trying to kill your kind.
too much confusion i want my mommy.
i want my mommy.
i want my mommy, bring me home.
you know it is too bad we never upgraded the ftl of this rap but if you think that i am gonna put up with your sniveling and wining for another dozen jumps guess again i want my mommy, bring me home.
fine.
let's see if you can cry in your sleep.
it might be a long snooze if i use one of these.
they don't come in kiddy doses.
give me your arm.
give me your arm.
saul, it's hera.
we've got to do more.
i got 'em to send out a recon mission.
yeah, a recon mission.
our people's future is at sake and you got 'em to send out a recon mission.
our people, our people that's right, saul! thank gods! frak! empty!
saul! you wanna know who are my people are, lady? the ones on this ship.
the ones i fought with and bled with, the old man, this crew, they're my family! the only family i've known and the only one i care to! oh, saul you are a pip.
you really are. the old man old? compared to who? you were my husband 2000 years before you even met bill adama.
that's what it means to me! it's nothing!
but that man's friendship oh, frak! you are a cylon, saul.
yeah.
whether you remember that life or not, at least you must understand what we were trying to do.
we wanted to end the cycle of war between men and machine.
that was the bust.
yes, we failed.
but we have a second chance now! hera.
without her our children are going to die off, one by one just like they are dying right now in cottle's sick bay.
i had a child.
he died.
you're wrong, saul.
you had millions.
ah, ellen.
come on, you got to be hungry.
eat this.
do you know what i do sometimes when i'm sad? i go to this special place the house where i wanted to live with the man that i loved.
you can see this? you can project?
yeah, you can still eat it.
missed a spot.
by your left sideburn.
the latch was busted.
thank you. so you really believe all that bilge you were spewing on the wireless?
bilge?
angels.
the angels walking among us.
angels that bring out our better nature, bla, bla, bla yes, i do as a matter of fact.
and you've seen these angels for yourself?
with alarming regularity.
regularity that must be important when you're full of crap.
oh, that's charming.
absolutely charming.
and you are entitled to an opinion, obviously.
who are you by the way, again?
me? i am a dead chick, that's it.
oh, right, and i'm full of crap.
no, i mean it.
im dead as in six feet under dead.
dead as in crashed landing and burned to a crisp dead.
here.
i took these off my body.
what was left of it, anyway on earth.
take them.
you used to be a scientist.
run some tests.
pull out the old cylon detector.
do whatever you need to do.
because i have no idea.
the only thing i know for sure im not an angel.
we tried hooking him up to the main power grid.
thought i might help him reset his neural net.
so in other words, you tried to jumpstart him like a car.
let me guess.
it didnt work so well for you.
take a break.
someone has to monitor id like a minute along with my husband.
i`mm sure you don`tt mind its funny, you know?
i i remember when i told you that if i found out you are cylon, i would put a bullet in your head.
some frakker makes me do it and all i can think about is how can i get you back.
human, cylon, does not seem to matter.
i just want you.
because you just a sam.
you are my sam.
and thats how i`mm gonna remember you.
neural anatomy of fluent aphasia are common flip a coin.
increased vascular pressure marks the threat response.
free will scuttles in the swamp of fear.
do not fear the worth.
you are the harbinger of death, kara thrace.
you will lead them all to their end.
end of line.
new command.
resume function.
resume function.
resume function.
and so i walk like the beat cop i used to be. when you walk, you see thing in different ways.
but when something is out place.
you notice it.
the cop eyes always notice.
and those eyes are the only thing that they couldnt take away from me.
what?
open the page 61.
dont worry.
cottle won't mind, it's medicinal i can not believe you saved this.
do you remember that day? yes.
new caprica.
baltar's gun breaking.
we've talked and talked.
about a lot of things.
guess what i am thinking about right now? give me a hint.
mountains.
a stream running to another lake.
water so clear.
its like looking through a glass.
your cabin.
the one you wanted to build.
its amazing how much i still think about it.
you know, sometimes i wonder what home is. is it actual place or is it some kind of longing for something, some kind of connection.
you know, i spent my whole life on caprice.
i was born in one house, and a then i i moved to another.
and then this.
and then now.
i dont think that i ever felt truly at home until these last few months here with you.
i know you love this ship.
probably, love her more than you love me.
billy, if don't get off this ship you may lose both of us at the same time.
would you give us a chance?
a closed system has lacks the ability to renew it self.
knowledge alone is a poor primer.
it is happening all over the ship.
power surges, temperature fluctuations and now you telling me its been him all along?
we had no idea that he had this ability.
how is he hooking into the ship?
i thought that all our systems were firewalled.
they are, and thats why we here hasn't accessed your computers.
but the organic resin that weve been injecting in your superstructure contains inductive elements, not unlike the neural fibers.
so he must have linked to those and then through them the electrical circuitry embedded in galactica's bulkheads.
and what about ftl? now weve been upgraded with your tech, are they vulnerable?
theoretically.
so, theoretically he could jump the ship if he wanted to just like yours did.
there's a hole in the bucket.
end of line.
begin reintegration of right hemisphere subcommand routines great!
that's all we need.
take him offline.
do it!
there's hole in the bucket, dear liza, dear liza, there is a hole in the bucket.
long due to return to patterns and repetitions.
all this happened before and all will happen again.
it's a blessed relief.
cavil moved the colony.
when?
judging from residual energy readings, about five months ago.
just before the civil war.
and you do not have idea where he moved to.
no.
excuse me.
anything you're imagining here can be real as you wanted to be.
do you want to see a special room?
a room where i thought my daughter would live?
sir.
can i walk with you, sir? i'm going to the funeral.
i understand if you are not going.
i would like your permission, sir, to take out raptor to go and look for my daughter.
i am sure that athena would be willing to pilot.. i've already sent out a recon mission and they reported back.
you did? we're looking for a facility we knew boomer would probably take hera, but it was no longer there sir.
let me take out that raptor.
maybe i can find something.
it's gone.
i have lost the son and you've lost the a daughter.
but i can not condone a suicide mission.
let it go!
you wanted me to let it go?
you're the one who can't let go.
covering the holes in this bucket?
this ship is dead.
but my daughter might be still alive!
i understand your pain, captain.
but don't lecture me.
you are here to take orders.
do you understand? i'm sorry.
i i'm sorry.
one raptor, admiral.
maybe this is a suicide mission, but at least give me chance to do something.
please.
for those who weve lost in the past, and for those who we buried today they gave their lives we must remember to save this ship.
there is a higher purpose.
casualties, as much as every soldier fallen.
and so we mourn in battle the passing of our friends.
heavenly father we must understand, grant us the strength, that what we sacrificed here today the wisdom our women and men.. and above all, a measure of acceptance of extreme courage however small.
cause that is what we are.. voyagers, traversing the stars, in search of grace.
grace.
so say we all.
so say we all.
so say we all.
so say we all.
present arm!
dismissed.
listen to me! the death is not the end.
and i'm not talking about cylon resurrection, i'm talking about the gift of eternal life, that is offered to each and everyone of us.
yes, even these flawed amongst us.
all we need is the courage to face death, when it comes crawling for us, embrace it even.
only then will we truly have the ability to cross over.
as one amongst us here, has already crossed over.
one amongst us, here, is living proof that there is life after death! the blood on these dog tags comes from necrotic flesh.
that means a dead body.
the dna analysis is a 100% prove positive match for one captain kara thrace.
i told you that are angels walking amongst you.
when will you believe me? she took these from her own mortal remains.
that lie on earth, even now, it's there with her bones.
that's enough, baltar!
ask her yourselves!
she will not deny it!
she's not a cylon.
i will put you in the brig!
they've already been revealed to us! ask her yourselves!
she will not deny it!
dismissed, everyone!
off the deck, now! kara?
what are you doing?
ok, listen to me.
i don't care.
right?
i don't we've all been through some crazy, crazy stuff.
i don't care what you think you saw.
i watched your viper explode.
i don't care.
i'm here.
you're here.
this is all that matters.
ok.
i'll see you around.
kara thrace.
everything went smoothly, i take it.
yes.
it's a shame i can't be there to see the expression on ellen's face when she realizes how we played her.
you've hard day's work, go get some rest.
we'll take her from here.
don't worry, we'll take good care at her. boomer, no! boomer!
there, there now.
you'll have all sorts of new playmates very soon.
boomer!
boomer!
i know you can hear me, sam.
just like i know at some level, you'll understand.
the old me is dead and gone same as the old you.
just took me a while to accept it.
which brings us to the larger question.
why am i here?
i think it has something to do with this music.
there's a pattern there's a pattern that i can't see.
but i think that you can.
so we are going to sit in this room until we figure it out.
talk to me, sam.
new command.
you wanted to see me? yeah.
i've made some decisions.
good.
about time you send those toaster workers back for all good they've done.
actually i'm stop all the repairs in the ship.
put out the orders, i want the crew to start strip out galactica.
packing all the weapons and gear.
start off-loading the civilians by tomorrow.
the full crew and officers transferred by the end of the week.
what?
we're abandoning ship, tigh.
no.
no, you can't do this.
i have to, saul.
she's dying.
and we both know it.
as your xo, i can't let you do this.
i won't!
you have never let me down, saul.
i can't blame you for being what you are.
specially since it includes being the finest officer and friend i've ever had.
this ship never let us down so, we're gonna send her off in style.
so we're gonna do this now?
she was a grand old lady.
the grandest!
to galactica! the ship in the fleet.
to galactica!
original italian subs by ::italian subs addicted::.
previously on battlestar galactica the cylons have established a human police force.
hundreds of us had been rounded up by the cylons, held in detention, questioned, tortured.
what's this? this orders a summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page.
it requires your signature.
sign it!
sign your name! the cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
i want to explain.
she sold us out.
you know what has to be done here.
now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
you're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive.
i'd like to see my client.
if they want to kill me, they'll find a way.
no! with baltar's lawyer injured, his defense will need help.
dad, why not me?
i'm close to the case, i've read the documents.
you're a cag, you're not a lawyer.
i will not allow you to sit across the court room on the other side, defending gaius baltar.
is that an order?
i'm through giving you orders.
battlestar galactica season - episode 19  crossroads  1/2 transcript frm and thanks, insults, critics kotaro, lovechange, nikomagnus hera?
hera! we finally got greenleaf's ftl nailed down, sir. the fleet's ready to jump again.
how many more before we find the nebula?
i'm estimating an even dozen.
we're getting close.
still no sign of the cylons?
no sir, we've left a trailing bird in every jump site.
no dradis contacts, no sighting, nothing.
alter the mission orders of the trailing raptor.
tell them to remain an additional hours before catching up with the fleet.
yes, sir.
you're up, superstar!
you know this game's got frack all to do with the real thing, right?
i didn't hear you nuggets say that for begin.
i don't really care what anybody there, go back, you almost got it.
got what? that song.
you don't hear that song?
no.
come on, you're up, let's go.
yeah.
baltar was instrumental on the cylon attack on the colonies.
the president wants him charged with genocide.
i can't make it stick.
there is no evidence of his involvement.
the president saw him with one of the sixes on caprica, before the attacks.
you really want me to put laura roslyn on the stand to testify about her drug induced visions?
what we want is for you to do your job and convict him.
you can't do that, we'll find someone who will.
this a courtesy meeting, not a strategy session.
i am charging baltar with what i can prove. of course i do serve at the pleasure of the president and if she decides to replace me, i'm sure there are other lawyers willing to take up the case.
if there are any other lawyers.
doctor baltar?
who are you?
look, i'm terribly sorry, i'm under strict instructions from my attorney not to speak to any members of the press.
no, doctor baltar, i i want you to look at this picture.
this is my son.
he's sick and i want you to bless him.
bless him !
please i'm terribly sorry, i can't help you.
i'm not god, the god or god of any derivation thereof.
please, i i can't bless him, i'm sorry.
i don't have any special powers.
i believe in you.
that's flattering.
what's going on here?
this place is becoming like a zoo.
i'm on trial for my life, i need a bit of privacy.
just pray for him, please.
please.
time to go.
i'll do my best.
you can save him.
yeah, mind how you go, now.
how many is that, now? five.
not including the 30 or 40 who've written letters.
well, i suppose it can't be helped.
celebrity trials invariably bring out the crazies.
you think that they're crazy.
you see, i saw a woman in pain.
i saw a woman who can see you more clearly than you can see yourself.
even if they kill you, your name will live on forever.
galactica, viper 289.
we're clear and in position for rear  picket.
roger 289.
have fun watching our ass, racetrack.
have fun watching baltar's ass get nailed.
all right, get comfortable.
like bait on a hook, wait and see if the cylons are still following us.
just shut up and deal, okay?
how do we measure loss?
how do we measure loss?
we measure it in the faces of the dead.
the faces that haunt our memories and our dreams.
how do we measure loss?
we mesure it on our own faces, the ones we see in the mirror every day because it has marked each of us.
so, how do we mesure loss?
when the scale of it becomes too hard to absorb any other way, we use numbers.
how many killed?
how many maimed?
how many missing?
and when those numbers become too vast to comprehend, as they did two years ago, we had to turn it around.
we began to count the living, those of us who has survived, to continue the saga of the human race.
the sum total of survivors from the twelve colonies who settled on new caprica with president gaius baltar as their leader and protector.
our number the day after we escaped.
and the missing number the one that no one wants to face.
killed, left behind or simply disappeared. of all that remains of the human race lost.
the citizen of the 12 colonies entrusted their fate and their lives to gaius baltar.
what we received was a reign of terror that staggers our mind and breaks our hearts.
instead of governance, we got tyranny.
instead of justice, we got oppression.
instead of a president, we got a murderer.
today, humanity holds him accountable for his crimes.
gaius baltar is not a victim.
gaius baltar chose to side with the cylons and to actively seek the death of his fellow citizens.
for that, he must pay the ultimate price.
your honors, the defense would like to change our plea to guilty.
what?
counsellor, are you sure you want to do that?
no, but what choice do i have?
i mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.
he's a traitor and a killer.
he's no better than the cylon and what do we do with them?
throw 'em out the airlock!
that's right!
throw 'em out the airlock!
this man sold us to our enemy.
this man is our enemy.
and if there's one thing that's good in war, that is right and just and proper, it's slaughtering our enemy!
getting some righteous payback!
what are we waiting for?
let's just kill him now! it'd be easier, wouldn't it?
simpler.
justice of the mob.
it's what they want.
especially her.
she's been wanting this for over a year now.
ever since he beat her in a free and fair election of the people.
now she gets a chance to exact her revenge upon a man whose only real crime is bowing to the inevitable.
gaius baltar saved the lives of the people on new caprica where laura roslin would have seen us all dead.
victims of a battle we had no hope in winning.
i don't know about you, but i'm glad she wasn't the president when the cylons arrived and said surrender or die.
i owe my life to gaius baltar and the decision he made that day.
so does laura roslin.
yeah, like you frakking know.
i know you wank it in your rack.
lady's man you see, that's called self-healing.
okay, time check.
oh, we got something.
lots of company.
three, four no five baseships.
crap! they're right on top of us.
frak.
frak! incoming!
the ftl's still spinning up.
we've got to jump.
now, godsdamn it.
now! begin searching the entire fleet for tracking devices.
it's possible they could have placed one on a ship on new caprica.
i think that we should ask the six.
she may be willing to help.
baltar's girlfriend.
why would she do that?
because she doesn't want to see hera go back to the cylons.
you think that thing would stick her neck out for some half-cylon whelp?
i have a feeling she'd lay her life down for it.
a feeling.
it's more that a feeling, all right?
why just do it.
it doesn't hurt to ask.
no.
ask the prisoner if it knows of any tracking devices in the fleet.
with pleasure.
the president, gods bless her sunny optimistic soul, thinks you might want to share how your buddies have been tracking us.
so i'm here to ask the question and listen to your lies. in the last battle, we discovered your fuel ship had a unique radiation signature.
they must have found a way to track it.
what else do you know?
what other secrets are rattling around inside that mechanical brain?
don't be intimidated by him.
he's just using you to exorcise his own pain.
poor old sod. he lost someone close to him.
you know how that feels, don't you?
i know a lot of things.
you want to know one thing i know?
i know about your loss. it hurts, doesn't it?
you wonder how you can even survive it.
i don't know what you're talking about.
but it's not gonna work.
she was his world. of course, he only realized when she was gone.
did she know?
did she know?
did she know how much she meant to you? or did you wait to tell her till she was gone?
what?
bet you made her think that she was a burden.
a millstone around your neck.
but then you humans always destroy the ones who love you, don't you shackle this thing.
colonel tigh.
excuse me.
what was the question again?
as the leader of the insurgency, did you ever hear of an instance in which baltar stood up to the cylons or tried to disrupt their plans?
oh, no, never. he never lifted a frakkin' finger to help us.
ellen did more.
at least she was trying to help us.
oh my gods, he's drunk.
yes.
yes, ellen, your wife.
another victim of baltar's cylon allies.
yeah, that's right.
yep.
thank you, colonel.
your witness.
what happened to his wife?
she used to work for one of the cylon administrators.
she worked for them?
you know what happened to her? no, no idea.
i presume she died in the exodus from new caprica.
colonel.
you dislike gaius baltar because you consider him to be a traitor. is that correct? and a coward and a mass murderer.
the suicide bombing of the police graduation.
gaius baltar was the intended target, was he not?
and if he'd had the guts to show up that day like he was supposed to, you and i wouldn't be having this conversation right now.
so you ordered the killing of-- what was it?
33 other men and women, just for the chance to kill gaius baltar.
they were all traitors.
anyone who put on that uniform.
but yes, he was the target.
what happened to your wife?
exception.
relevance?
the door was opened on direct.
i fail to see the point of pursuing-- he's right, admiral.
if it was brought up during the direct, than it can be pursued in the cross.
overruled.
continue.
what happened to your wife, you frakkin' son of a bitch-- isn't it true that she collaborated openly with the cylons, that actually she worked for them?
she was faking it.
making them think that she was working for them.
i see, yeah.
and baltar, he wasn't faking it, no.
that's right.
and you blame him for her death.
have you been drinking today, colonel?
i had a drink.
i haven't been drinking.
you used to like to drink with ellen, i imagine.
you hear that?
they're playing music in here now? what the hell is he talking about?
gaius baltar didn't order the death of your wife.
colonel, that was somebody else.
who was it, colonel?
who killed ellen?
come on, colonel, we're waiting.
tell us.
who was it?
who killed ellen?
i did! i did.
i did.
she was giving information to the cylons.
a lot of good men died.
she was my wife. it was my responsibility.
she did it for me.
that's what she said.
to save me from going back to prison so they could tear more pieces off me.
so i killed her.
all because of that thing over there.
all because gaius frakkin' baltar didn't have the guts to stand up to the cylons.
because he handed our fates over to the cylons, i had to kill my ellen.
so gaius baltar made you kill your wife.
that's why you hate him.
and that's why you'd say anything to see him die.
you're godsdamned right i would.
i would do anything say anything to see that man die a painful death.
no further questions.
will someone turn off that music? earlier today, eight protestors were arrested on okay, are you hearing what i'm saying?
my gods.
a contingency of colonial marines were deployed to the ship what can i get you?
i don't know what i want.
you figure it out.
you're the bartender.
okay.
tell you what.
i'll surprise you.
yes, finally!
thank you! about time.
i'm not a bad coach, huh? one more time.
yeah.
i was grading papers in the schoolhouse at night and they came again.
fortunately, the children were gone.
it was after dark.
they took close to under baltar's direct orders.
as it turned out, all of our names were on a death list signed by dr.
baltar.
let us be crystal clear on this fact.
you are saying that the defendant, gaius baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people?
yes, indeed.
that's exactly what i'm saying.
we need to talk.
we need to find something, anything, that can discredit her testimony.
she's a fanatic, right?
i don't know if that's gonna help.
you're awfully quiet.
i was just listening.
you see, your problem is is that i'm a really good liar and you're not.
so let's have it.
have what?
my gods, he's right.
you do know something.
you know something and you're not saying.
it's probably not even true.
i like it already.
it's a personal matter.
i doubt she'd ever say anything in front of me.
she! this is about laura roslin.
and you're not tell me, tell me! shut up! enjoying yourself so far.
enjoying s in it to the old man, defending the world's most hated person.
that's not why i agreed to do this.
no! you just decided to stand up for truth and justice and all those other lovely things we inscribed upon courtroom doors.
yeah.
that's exactly what i'm doing.
because i believe in the system.
i really believe i even believe that our low life pond scum of a client actually deserves a fair trial.
the system requires that you tell what you know.
which leaves you with one of two uncomfortable options.
first, share the information and in so doing uphold the very principles that you claim to hold so dear or second keep'em to yourself, and prove, once and for all, your only purpose here is to jab your father in the eye and make a mockery of the entire justice system.
that's very nice.
very, very nice.
but i know why i'm here.
i don't need to prove it to you or to anyone else.
you're wrong.
you need to prove it to yourself, or you leave that courtroom out knowing you kept a secret that could've saved that man's miserable life.
now unless i greatly misjudged your character, that's not something that lee adama wishes on his conscience.
so what'll it be, major?
sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties.
or are you gonna get in this trial and give us something we can use?
come on.
come on, there we go.
here we go.
give me that.
you had enough of that already.
i know, i know.
that a boy.
don't worry.
got some good news today.
we found the radiation signature on the tylium ship.
just like the cylon prisoner said we would.
good.
that's great.
being repaired as we speak.
mr.
gaeta estimates the fleet's nine jumps away from the nebula.
considering how long it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship.
we're out maybe three days.
three days out from the next clue on the road to earth.
i can't smell her.
can't smell her anymore, bill.
i kept her clothes.
but her smell is gone now.
i gotta go, saul.
gotta retire.
i'm sorry about all that in court.
there's nothing to be sorry about.
i embarrassed you.
made you look bad.
you're my oldest friend, saul.
you never embarrass me.
get some rest.
can a former cag make a radical suggestion to the admiral?
what if we don't fix the tylium ship?
repairs have already started.
i realize that, but hear me out.
we're too closed to the nebula to simply fix the problem and hope the cylons can't guess where we're going.
so, if we don't fix it.
if instead we send the ship off on a new course, with a couple of raptors riding shotgun let them make a few jumps before rejoining the fleet, it might throw the cylons off.
it's a good idea.
i'll take it into consideration.
is there anything else? how's the president?
what? is she okay?
she looked a little rattled in court, yesterday.
we can't talk about the trial outside the court.
you know that, or you should.
i know.
i wasn't asking about after what you did to tigh you're the last person i would consider to confide in.
me? i didn't do anything to tigh. he was drunk.
it's really not my fault.
you told lampkin about ellen.
i didn't know about ellen.
yeah, right.
you're calling me a liar?
i'm calling you a liar and a coward.
one who doesn't have the guts to go after a man himself.
instead, you hand the shift to a stranger.
and let him stab tigh in the back.
and for what?
traitorous piece of garbage gaius baltar.
doesn't even deserve a trial.
are you done?
yes.
then so am i. i will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
and i won't have an officer under my command i'll see you in court, admiral.
let me do this.
what? are you sure, major?
it's mister now.
and yeah, i'm sure. it should be me.
you're not gonna let my security  we're waiting, mr.
lampkin.
if it'd pleases the court, my associate, mr.
adama, will question the witness.
his associate the defense may proceed.
thank you. madam president, aren't you alive today because of gaius baltar?
i'm alive today because the insurgents managed to stop the execution.
well, they saved you from a cylon  squad but wasn't it baltar who saved your life when you were dying from cancer?
relevance?
your honors, hostile witness, your honors.
if the court would grant us just a little latitude.
we'll allow it.
thank you. did gaius baltar save your life when you were dying from cancer?
doctor baltar's scientific knowledge did save my life, indeed.
can you be more specific?
how did he save your life on that occasion? he injected me with the blood of a half-cylon, half-human baby.
and your cancer vanished?
completely.
during your illness, what sort of medication were you on?
i was taking a lot of medications at the time and i don't remember all their names.
did you take something called chamalla extract?
yes.
isn't it true that one of the side effects of taking chamalla is a propensity to experience hallucinations?
yes.
that is one of the possible side effects of chamalla.
and isn't it also true that the visions that you once described as messages from the gods were actually the results of a pharmacological logical reaction from taking chamalla?
the chamalla did enable me to see things that were foretold by the scriptures, things that will help this fleet find his way to earth.
you should know that, major.
your honors.
mr.
adama, where're you going with this? just one more question, your honor.
please, don't do this.
please.
madam president, are you taking chamalla at this time?
captain apollo, remember that?
i always thought it had such a nice ring to it.
and i am so, so sorry for you now.
chamalla, madam president.
perhaps dissolved in your tea to mask the bitterness.
don't answer.
i'm putting a stop to this, right now.
your honors, if she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness.
witness is dismissed.
your honors, i have to strongly object.
he's trying to cover something up, here.
one more word from you, and you'll both be held for contempt.
admiral!
i'd like to hear the witness answer the question.
as would i. madam president, are you taking chamalla again?
yes, i am.
no further questions.
mr.
adama, aren't you going to ask me why? i'm sorry?
why am i taking chamalla again?
it's not strictly relevant.
perhaps not to you, but it's relevant to me.
go ahead.
ask me why.
finish what you started.
why are you talking the chamalla again, madam president?
i am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
the fact she's having hallucinations is relevant to baltar's defense.
that's the way this system works, dee. the accused has the right to challenge the credibility of witnesses against him and that's just the way it is.
the system is broken, lee. the system elected that man to be president and the system is trying to let him walk.
the system doesn't deserve to be defended.
it deserves to be taken apart and put back together again.
you know, i wish i wish i could make you understand.
i do understand, lee.
that's why i'm leaving.
well, you don't.
you frakking don't.
madam president, how long have you known about the cancer?
about a week.
and how advanced is the disease?
will you be getting any more transfusions from the half-cylon donor?
this is the kind of detail i'm not going to now.
we're looking at a game plan.
i'll let you know when we have one.
how the treatment for your illness impact your duties as president?
so far, it hasn't at all. are you currently taking chamalla?
don't answer that.
how often do you hallucinate?
all right, enough of this crap.
we're done here.
tory.
you vultures can go pick over another carcass.
tory! come here.
i'll see you inside.
thank you. i'm sorry.
temperature is running a little high in the fleet these days.
who's next?
karen?
madam president, how long do you have to live? how long do you have to live, karen?
you handled that well.
you didn't.
picked over another carcass as opposed to mine that's gonna look good in the press.
i don't even know why i said that.
i what is up with you? you've been off your game, you're distracted, exhausted.
you're just, you know frankly, you're plain obnoxious.
i just haven't been slee very well.
you need to pull it together, and focus on your job, fast.
or i can find someone who can handle the press as well as pull a comb through their hair once a week.
lieutenant.
good morning, xo.
good morning.
it's just temporary.
the colonel will pull together.
right.
so, we're using the tylium ship as a decoy to lead the cylons along this course, here, almost directly opposite to ours.
when they'll reach this point here, they'll recalibrate the ftl, and jump back to the rendez-vous with galactica and the rest of the fleet, here, at the ionian nebula.
any indications the cylons are following them?
nothing yet.
and it would appear they stopped following us as well.
our trailing raptor has yet to pick up any sign of pursuit since the tylium ship left the fleet.
how many jumps until we reached the nebula?
it's hard to believe, we're down to the last three.
good. is there anything else, sir? no, no.
i was just just remembering back on caprica when the weather was about to change.
you'd you've got this smell in the air.
i mean, the sun could be out.
not a cloud in the sky.
but you pick up this smell and you knew that something was just over the horizon.
weather's changing, felix.
we need to be ready for it.
there's a storm coming.
it's in the ship.
it's in the frakking ship!
previously on battlestar galactica if that's me lying there, than what am i? she took these from her own mortal remains.
the blood on these dog tags is 100% proof positive match for one kara thrace.
sam! we tried hooking him up to the main power grid.
thought it might reset his neural net.
this has been happening all over the ship.
power surges, temperature fluctuations.
and now you're telling me it's been him all along? is that for me? hera wrote the notes to a song that my father used to play to me when i was a child.
the same song that led us to earth.
there's a pattern that i can't see.
but i think that you can.
so we are going to pick it apart until we figure it out.
it's impossible.
somebody saw her.
what the hell's going on up there?
boomer took hera, just walked right out of the daycare.
job well done.
don't worry.
we'll take good care of her.
boomer!
no, boomer!
if cavil's plan all along was to steal hera so he could study her, they'll take her to the colony.
that's where we and the centurions went after the first war.
we're abandoning ship, tigh.
put out the orders that i want the crew to start strip down galactica, packing all the weapons and gear.
i want to start offloading the civilians by tomorrow, full crew and ordinances transferred by the end of the week.
to galactica, best ship of the fleet.
to galactica.
i've commanded two battlestars and three escorts before that.
come on, bill.
don't be like that.
there's nothing to get all upset about.
billions of cubits worth of equipment entrusted to me not to mention thousands of lives.
it's one hour of your life.
look, sometimes there are things you just gotta do, all right?
you always drink and drive?
i drink, he drives.
you like having things done for you, don't you?
certainly beats having to do them for yourself.
don't you?
no, i prefer not to rely on others as much as possible.
less chance of being let down that way.
well, since you allowed yourself to be in my capable hands for this evening, here's ho i won't let you down.
i'll drink to that, doctor.
you can, um, you can call me gaius, actually, if you want.
this is crazy, but i've actually forgotten your name.
hello.
yes, it is.
oh, hello.
how are you?
what?
w- what?
oh, my gods.
when was this? oh, well, um, well, listen, just, uh, i'm so sorry.
uh, if you just wait there and-and i'll be around as soon as i ca- no, please.
you have to wait.
you have to- you can't meet- you will wait there or i'll sue you for abandonment.
yeah, i will.
well, i don't know how long it's gonna take.
just-just wait.
i'm coming.
i'm coming right now.
give my love to sydney!
i will!
bye.
bye.
oh. that was a great shower.
oh.
oh, my gods.
that was amazing.
just gonna clean up a little bit here.
no. no.
laura, no cleaning.
aw.
just a little.
no.
this is the last bottle and you and i have to share it.
you promised me you would finish all the champagne.
all right.
oh, boy.
we drank a lot.
well, they did.
they did.
what about me? uh no.
pregnant girls only get gifts.
just-just a sip. a sip? just a sip.
all right.
just one little.
little.
go ahead.
stop!
enough.
oh, my gosh.
oh.
oh. that was lovely, laura.
thank you. well, it's the least i can do for my little sister.
hey, i thought i was your little sister.
okay, you are my really little sister.
mm.
hmm.
oh, boy.
how about that woman with mrs.
anderson?
why did she bring those?
who was she? i don't know.
but, you know, there's always one.
aw.
oh, frak me.
he's early.
just a second!
coming!
hi, i'm- you must be- lee.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
i'm sorry.
i'm kara.
come on in.
that's very nice.
you didn't have to do that.
oh.
i'll take those.
put 'em in some water.
zak! nice place.
it's a rattrap, but the rent's cheap.
no.
it's, uh it's it's got real charm.
and you're a terrible liar.
we should play cards.
i hold my own.
i'm sure you do.
zak! you just get uglier every day.
hey, there he is.
hey.
how are you?
ah.
i see you've met my better half.
and this one's mine.
keep your hands off.
and a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
nice.
never stole his girlfriend.
mm-hmm.
he's a really bad liar right here.
yeah.
no, we figured that out already.
zak, get the drinks.
dinner's almost ready.
yes, sir.
i don't-i don't know what to say.
i'm-i'm sorry.
it was a mistake.
nothing in my contract about being stabbed with my steak knife.
she be stealing.
she been stealing while i've been slee.
no one is stealing from you, dad, all right?! now you just shut up.
you're in enough trouble already.
i'm out of here.
you're lucky i don't call the cops.
yes.
yes, we are, nurse barbara.
thank you. now listen.
i'll pay you double.
triple.
i thought i asked you to wait in the car.
this be the new one you be banging, eh? none of your bloody business.
nurse barbara, please.
i've got 500 cubits.
1,000.
1,000 frakking cubits for you to stay the night!
please!
i'll take all the knives away!
he'll be on liquid diet forever.
just spend one frakking night!
how about you, love?
bet you charge a lot more than that, eh? shut your filthy mouth.
stop being so disgusting.
this is your father, gaius.
not that you'd ever know it.
you see, gaius is ashamed of his family.
i need this.
i need this like a frakking hole in the head.
even his accent.
stupid bastard actually changed his accent.
would you believe that? that is the third nurse in a row now, dad. the third nurse.
do you have any idea how much this is costing?
how much it costs.
that's all he cares about now.
not the way he was brought up, i can tell ya.
but he don't like to think about that.
no, he don't like to think about living on the farm and doing a day's hard work.
all right.
all right.
all right.
enough! enough! shut up! shut up right now! i won't stand here one moment longer and listen to your ridiculous working class hero rant- look at you! look at your shirt that i bought you.
how you dribble and treat these things.
i'll break it down for you, dad! you're an obnoxious, spiteful, cantankerous old git, and you're frakking lucky you're not living on the frakking street!
big man cursing his father.
makes you feel important, does it?
gaius, maybe we should- maybe you should've stayed in the car, which is what i asked you to do.
i'm afraid that i'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
i'm sure that the driver can see you to your home.
i'm gonna spend the rest of this lovely evening with my dad.
good night.
good morning.
i'm officer stephanie and this is officer shawn with the caprica city police.
are you laura roslin?
yes, i am.
we need to speak with you.
may we come inside?
yes, please do.
we're so sorry we have to inform you there's been a terrible accident.
late last night, your sisters and your father were all killed.
we weren't able to verify the identity of the bodies until a few hours ago. the driver of the other vehicle is in stable condition.
and preliminary tests indicate he was intoxicated when he sideswiped the car with your father and your sisters.
thank you. please show yourselves out.
we're sorry for your loss.
i don't know.
i don't know what she's doing.
there's only so much of galactica to go around.
you'd think we're retiring ten battlestars.
excuse me, mr.
president, sir.
one second.
tell the captains they are padding their requests.
send it back.
sir, if you have a minute.
just one second.
yeah, specialist, what is it?
i know this is not your problem, sir, but they want us to tear the mag-cellerators >from the launch tubes.
well, the civilian ships can use them as, uh, auto-loaders.
sir, it's like we're tearing the old girl's heart out.
a battlestar's whole purpose is to launch vipers.
i kind of know how you feel.
part of my heart's here too.
tell you what make the cellerators the last thing your men take out.
then turn out the lights and let the old girl die in peace.
yes, sir.
well, after the blast, everyone else's numbers are down, which gives us solid majorities on over half the civilian ships in the fleet.
i mean, no one else comes even close to having that kind of political power.
our time is here, gaius.
she's right, gaius.
the end times are approaching.
humanity's final chapter's about to be written and you-you will be its author.
gaius, did you hear me? this is it.
this is it, gaius.
are you, um, are you thirsty before- what the hell are you doing here?
what's going on?
how did you get in here?
should i go- what you should do is go up those stairs, turn left, go in the bedroom, and get ready.
you are an intruder in my home.
i think it would be a good idea if you left before i inform the authorities.
fine, fine.
if that's the way you want to play it, then, uh, then-you see, i'm ringing the police.
i'm dialing.
hello, police department, please.
i found your father a new place to live.
yes, i'd like to re- what? the regency.
down by the wharf.
very tony address.
full-time care, social activities, medical staff.
and the best part they encourage residents to garden and grow their own food.
julius will be a farmer again.
his things are being moved this very moment by the staff.
they'll be set up in his new room exactly how he had them in the apartment.
he loves it.
loves?
once i showed him around the facility.
your father's a very complicated man, gaius, but there's a few simple things that make him very happy.
the last time i saw him he seemed happy.
sorry, sir.
as i was saying, the old man intends to fly the last viper off ship himself.
tell the deck gang to leave one launch tube intact, set to remote pilot launch.
yes, sir.
you'll never make admiral like that.
they're all the same, karl.
no, they're different.
you know they're different.
how you felt about boomer, that was different.
that's why you did what you did.
hmph.
i did what i did because i'm a frakkin' idiot.
a 2,000-year-old idiot who cannot learn the simplest lesson.
machines are not people.
they're just machines.
my wife, athena, is a person.
she's a blow-up doll, karl.
they all are.
athena, sharon, boomer.
call 'em at you will.
they're all the same.
they're all the same because we made them the same.
don't blame yourself, but you can't trust 'em.
you can't trust any of 'em.
dots.
lots and lots and lots of dots.
she's clearly very gifted.
she hasn't eaten in days.
i think we should begin intravenous nutritional supplements to build up her strength before we begin testing.
she wants her mother.
she can't have her mother now, can she?
oh, i'm sorry.
i- i forgot to sound all soppy and soft when speaking of the child.
she is a child.
a frightened one.
she's a half human, half machine object of curiosity that holds the key to our continued existence somewhere in her genetic code.
so let's get a tube in her and get her ready.
frak.
you didn't hear that, all right?
let me help you.
these are- pilots from the memorial wall.
we wanted to take them with us, you know, so we wouldn't leave them behind with the others.
the others.
lotta of photos still down there.
nobody knows who they are anymore.
probably friends or relatives of people on galactica who died somewhere along the way.
admiral.
as you were.
bear it in mind?
well, when will you bear it in mind?
you haven't even listened to my proposal.
i'm not even saying it was necessarily be me.
my people deserve a voice in the government.
now, i'm literally talking about the lives and well-being of thousands of people in the fleet.
is that what you were thinking about when you outed starbuck's secret? the well-being of thousands of people? or the political gain of gaius baltar-again? is that what this is about?
does everything have to be reduced to your personal feelings about kara thrace?
listen to me, mr.
adama.
lee, i'm asking to have a genuine conversation.
please.
five minutes.
i'll be back in five minutes.
five minutes inside.
and you think there's some kind of meaning in these musical notes.
i don't know.
i'm just gro mostly.
looking for patterns.
trying to see what comes to me.
i thought that if i assigned numbers to the notes i don't know.
what baltar said the other day, is it the truth?
yeah.
i found my body and i burned it on earth.
i don't know what i am.
i have to ask him a question.
do you know how to plug him in?
yeah.
hey.
i know what you are.
you're my daughter.
don't forget it.
you're on pace to land in the hall of fame some day.
but you still haven't won a championship and now the c-bucs are in a rebuilding year.
if you don't get to hoist the cup before you retire, will you consider your career to be incomplete?
well, right now, i'm just, uh, focused on getting stronger and hel out the team any way i can.
um, i yeah.
hmm.
look, you want to know the truth?
i don't really care about the stats or the cup or the trophy or anything like that.
um, in fact, even the games aren't that important to me.
not really.
what matters to me is the perfect throw, okay?
making the perfect catch.
the perfect step and block.
it's perfection.
that's what it's about.
it's about those moments when you when you can feel the perfection of creation.
the-the beauty of physics.
the wonder of mathematics.
you know, the-the elation of action and reaction.
and that is the kind of perfection that i want to be connected to.
spins and turns.
angles and curves.
the shape of dreams half-remembered.
slip the surly bonds of earth and touch the face of perfection.
a perfect face.
perfect lace.
find a perfect world for the end of kara thrace.
end of line. he says a lot of things.
go ahead.
ask your question.
you ask him.
let's forget for one moment that you're the son of the admiral.
shut the frak up.
get to the frakkin' point.
you got five minutes.
speak.
galactica has been more than our ian.
she's literally a vessel into which we have poured all of our hopes and dreams.
and when she's gone, when we can no longer derive the security from looking out a window and seeing her massive bulk gliding by, then this life will be over and a new life will have begun.
a new life requires a new way of thinking.
now, i am willing to do anything- anything i can to make this new life a good one.
all i am asking is that my people have a voice in the government.
i represent thousands of people.
they-they deserve to be enfranchised just as much as anyone else.
i'm not talking about myself.
this is not for me personally.
come on, lee. it makes sense.
you know it's the right thing to do.
what i know is that in all the years that i've known you, i've never seen you make one truly selfless act.
right.
never seen you do something that didn't on some level serve the greater needs of gaius frakking baltar.
so, no, i won't take your hand.
and i won't bring you or any representative from your movement into the government.
right.
so, um, so that's what it boils down to.
my people can't get representation because i personally haven't passed lee adama's selfless altruism test.
i haven't been a goody-goody and won a badge of honor.
i don't think you've passed gaius baltar's test.
go ahead, look me in the eye and tell me about the time that you made a truly heroic act of conscience which helped you not even in the slightest.
tell me! i'll even believe you.
you're right.
i wouldn't trust me either.
holy frak.
i dare you.
i double-dog dare you.
get out of here!
come on!
come on.
come on.
come on!
attaboy.
attaboy!
stupid frakkin' bird.
can i have your attention, please?
i'm sure you're all aware that a child was abducted from this ship recently.
i thought that a rescue mission was impractical.
well, i was wrong.
he didn't say where he got the information, but starbuck was there, so i bet he talked to anders.
yeah.
i know.
pretty freaky.
he thought that a rescue mission was impractical because he didn't know where she was being held.
but that's changed now, i guess, because he does know where she's being held. of course, knowing where the colony is is not nearly the same thing as being able to actually get her out.
this is insane.
you know that, right?
what i know is that hera has some meaning that transcends the here and now.
she's meant to fulfill a role just as we were.
so we're going, the five of us.
oh, you're making decisions for all of us now.
you'll go, tory.
truth is, you never could be alone.
yeah, the mission is to be, uh, strictly volunteer only.
any man or woman over the age of 15. and the admiral also wants any former colonial officer or crewmen incarcerated after the recent mutiny.
yeah.
yeah.
that's it.
everyone has to make their own choice and they have to do it in person.
the old man is waiting on the hangar deck.
set in-port watch until you get back.
watch keepers report to the admiral's quarters to declare yourselves in person.
move.
you know what you're gonna do? not exactly.
well, take your time.
takes approximately four minutes to get down there.
it's really happening.
we're going after her. or what's left of her.
cavil's probably had her sliced and diced and cut up into a thousand specimens- stop it.
just stop it, okay?
she's still alive.
and she's still out there.
and we're gonna get her.
and everything's gonna be all right.
it's not gonna be all right, karl.
no.
you're wrong.
you're wrong.
i know it's been three months.
i know that.
i do too go out.
i do.
i do.
un-uh.
no.
mm-mm.
no, i'm not joining baltar's presidential campaign.
i don't care.
because i don't like politics to begin wit and a national campaign is just so-dah.
oh, gods, you are relentless.
wha-okay, okay.
i'll-ah ah.
i'll make you a deal.
i'll go on the date if you'll stop bugging me about this campaign.
how young is he? wha i know.
okay.
i made a deal.
what's mr.
perfect's name?
oh, sean.
i like that name.
sean what?
sean allison?
sounds familiar.
okay.
all right.
bye.
ugh.
no one should feel obligated to join this mission in any way!
this is a decision i have made for myself.
if it turns out that there are not enough personnel to crew galactica i will lead a raptor assault with anyone who is willing to join me.
let there be no illusions!
this is likely to be a one-way trip.
so don't volunteer out of sentiment or emotion.
there is a line running down this deck.
volunteers, move to the starboard side!
everyone else, to the port.
make your choice.
doc.
we can't afford to lose a doctor.
go on back, sherman.
and thank you. like you got something better to do.
excuse me.
thank you. oh.
you didn't think you were gonna take off without me, admiral, did you?
never crossed my mind, madam president.
jump complete.
frak! plot us a way the hell back out of here.
right.
you got it.
figures that a brain damaged cylon would send us hunting in the middle of an asteroid field.
the more things change, the more they stay the same.
well, you got a recon mission where someone needs to hang their ass over the edge and wait for a bite, send racetrack and skulls.
well, beats sittin' in a cell.
long range dradis just picked something up.
holy frak, we're right on top of a singularity.
a black hole?
where away?
we're already sliding toward it.
spin up the ftl.
we're getting out of here.
oh, frak me.
what?
you're not gonna believe this.
based on the coordinates we've determined that the cylon colony is located here.
it's within our jump range, but there's a sizable catch.
it's located within an accretion disk of a naked singularity.
it's a strategically sound position.
the colony's bound within the gravity well of the black hole, but maintains a stable orbit.
how do we get in there?
look at all the crap floating around in that current.
there is no way to navigate that current.
the tidal stresses are too strong.
it would rip the ship apart before we got within ten s. u. but there is one safe jump spot.
it's where they bring their baseships in and out.
we got lucky.
two baseships jumped in and out while the raptor was taking pictures.
this right here is our only parking spot.
that's right on top of the frakking thing.
less than one click by our estimates.
one click?
point blank range.
and you can bet that they will have every gun in that colony pointed at that parking spot of yours.
that's what i'd do.
leave only one way in and out then make it impossible to get past the gates.
all right.
let's get to work.
subtitle ripped by leapinlar, edited and synced by rogard.
- this is it.
that's it.
the ionian nebula.
so what do you think we'll find?
beacon?
temple?
sign post to earth?
how many more jumps before we find the nebula?
i'm estimating an even dozen.
we're getting close.
still no sign of the cylons.
you nuggets would say that.
what anybody there, go back, you almost had it.
had what? that song.
you don't hear that song?
it's in the frakking ship! this is my son.
i am very sorry for your loss, but i am not responsible.
i know, he's sick, and i want you to bless him.
bless him?
you are saying that the defendant, gaius baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people?
that's exactly what i'm saying.
this a death warrant.
have you seen the names on this list?
do you know what they will do out there? gaius baltar chose to side with the cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.
madam president, are you taking chamalla at this time?
don't answer.
i'm putting a stop to this right now.
your honors, if she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness.
i am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
i'm calling you a liar and a coward.
for what?
traitorous piece of garbage gaius baltar.
he doesn't even deserve a trial.
i will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
and i won't have an officer under my command who doesn't have any.
battlestar galactica season - episode 20  crossroads  2/2 = season finale - transcript thanks, insults, critics, goufrach, lovechange, nikomagnus frak me.
yes? yell at me. i don't want to get out of bed.
you called the wrong number.
i was just thinking about going back to bed.
you feeling okay? says the cancer patient.
yeah, i'm fine.
i just cut myself.
how are you doing?
i don't want to face them.
i don't want to face any of them.
i just want to stay in bed all day and sleep.
i think i stopped the bleeding.
if you still need to be yelled at, i think i can give you some volume.
okay.
all right, give it your best shot.
get out of that bed! that's not your best shot.
get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, roslin!
yes, sir.
okay, sir.
anything you say, sir.
thank you. don't let 'em see you sweat, laura.
come here.
i can't.
come here.
i gotta go back to the colonial one.
you don't have to go anywhere.
what is that music?
gods.
what did you just say? frak.
yeah, coming.
hey, why's the door locked?
sorry.
we should go for a mistrial.
what?
what's he talking about?
what are you talking about?
mistrial?
whatever for?
because we're losing.
not from where i'm standing.
we're actually doing quite well.
we're about to break the prosecution.
we've blown of their key witnesses out of the water.
what more do we need to do, for gods sakes?
everyone in that courtroom hates you.
everyone.
including the judges.
you didn't hear what my father just called you. a traitorous piece of garbage, a man who doesn't even deserve a trial.
he said that? he actually said that? yes, he did.
and i don't think he's the only one up there.
i agree.
our tactical victories are pissing them off.
right, so now because we're winning we're losing, actually.
perverse, isn't it?
one of the reasons why i love what i do.
forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side, but in fact, it can be a boon to the defense.
the prosecution's shown their hand.
at retrial, the defense has all the tactical advantages, and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by 25%.
joseph adama.
trial tactics and strategies, page 273.
smart man, your grandfather.
yeah, well, i can see why you'd want a mistrial.
what's that supposed to mean? that'd be the quickest way for you to absolve all your responsibility.
wash your hands of the whole affair.
you get back to your life.
you get back to wherever you get back to, and i get back to a cell and i have to go through this all over again.
i can't physically take that.
no more games.
no mistrials.
there will be a verdict.
yesterday marked a surprising turn of events in the trial of dr.
gaius baltar, when colonel tigh admitted before any of you nuggets can even think about flying one of my raptors, you have to know systems.
electronics, avionics, navigation, engine controls, dradis configuration and calibration, basic ftl functions, autopilot gearing and propulsion systems the best way to learn that is on a raptor.
and that means getting your hands dirty.
move it.
come on.
come on, come on.
chief.
hey, sam.
that song you're .
what is that?
oh, you know what, i don't even know.
it's just something i can't get out of my head.
some way out of here i've been hearing that.
everywhere.
on a boom box, you know, in the bar.
come here.
you hear that song.
yeah.
it's freaking me out.
i hear it everywhere, but i can't but i can't really hear it, you know what i mean?
yeah, it's like you can grab just a part of the melody and then it goes away.
like it's something from childhood.
exactly.
yo, anders!
do you need a frakking invitation?
move it!
all right.
no reason to get excited.
well, congratulations.
you've survived your first doloxan treatment.
talk about the cure being worse than the disease.
next time bring a book or some paperwork.
it'll keep your mind off of it and it'll also keep your blood pressure down.
now if you excuse me, i do have some other patients.
all right, go.
oh, gods.
hera! what's going on?
you're both freaking out at the same time?
we need a moment.
take this off.
get this off me, please.
will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?
go outside.
thank you, we'll be fine.
shut the door.
yes, ma'am.
i'm sorry about the shackles.
were you with us a moment ago in the lobby of the opera house?
i'll take that as a yes by the look on your face.
i was there too.
and so was hera.
that shouldn't be possible.
add it to the list.
were you trying to reach hera?
i don't know.
i just knew that i had to protect her with my life.
i'm telling you, bill.
they put the music in the ship.
i can hear it.
i believe you.
i'll look into it.
you'll look into it?
you'll look into it?
i am here telling you there is cylon sabotage aboard our ship!
sabotage with music.
i know, i know.
i can't quite understand it myself, but there's too much confusion.
i promise i'll look into it.
now i have to get to court.
okay.
go to court.
there must be some kind of way out of here.
do you recognize this document, lieutenant?
yes, i do.
it's a death list issued on new caprica by the office of the president.
who signed this document?
president gaius baltar.
could it be a forgery?
no. and how do you know that it cannot be a forgery?
because i was there.
i saw him sign it.
what?
what are you talking about?
you weren't there!
that's a lie.
that's a total fabrication.
order!
i saw him sign it.
describe the scene, would you? the cylons brought the document into the presidential office.
they had already selected the names.
one of them-- i believe it was a three gave the list to the president and said: here are the people that are going to be executed.
please sign this. he looked at the list.
he saw all the names.
and then he signed it.
did he protest?
i mean, did he argue?
did he offer any resistance whatsoever?
sign it!
i won't do it.
you're going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
sign it!
sign your name!
no. he never did.
oh, felix.
oh, felix, what are you doing?
get that out of my face!
gaius, we'll get him in the cross.
counselor, please control your client.
it's not a secret.
quiet! the fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck, and you missed!
butterfingers! sorry, your honors.
shut up.
no further questions.
your witness, counselor.
no questions.
what?
what are you-- witness is dismissed.
oh, great.
what the hell are you doing?
it's your word against his right now.
if he's decided to perjure himself, we can't do anything to change that now.
we're going to have to adjust our strategy.
is the defense prepared to present their case?
your honors at this time, if it please the court i would like to offer a motion.
the defense would like to move for a mistrial.
no, we do not want a mistrial!
i do not want a mistrial!
gaius baltar!
behave, dr.
baltar.
on what grounds, counselor?
on the grounds that one of the panel has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt of the defendant.
that's a very serious charge, mr.
lampkin.
which judge? that would be you, admiral.
and to prove it, i need to take the unusual step of calling mr.
lee adama to the stand.
you gotta be frakkin' kidding me.
gaeta has sunk us.
this is the only way we're gonna win.
i will not testify against my father.
that is your choice.
either way, i'm putting you on the stand.
your honors, this is completely improper.
counsel cannot testify at trial under any circumstances.
i can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head.
call your witness, counselor.
thank you. mr.
adama.
mr.
adama did you meet with your father, admiral adama, four days ago? yes. at that meeting, did admiral adama express an opinion as to whether the defendant deserved a trial?
all i'm looking for is the truth here, mr.
adama.
let's have it.
i'm waiting.
answer the question.
you swore an oath as an officer of the court.
if you don't answer the question, you halt the entire system of justice.
what frakking system?! mr.
adama!
i'm sorry, your honors.
please excuse my associate.
all right.
i'll try something else.
do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial?
as a matter of fact, i do.
why? aside from the fact that everyone deserves a fair trial, i also believe that he is not guilty of the charges your honors, i must insist on an exception here.
he cannot testify in this manner.
it is completely improper.
i agree. he can make his arguments in closing statements, not on the stand.
i'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.
thank you. you can appeal to the president if you feel that this influences the verdict, but i for one would like to hear this witness testify.
i would second that.
continue.
thank you, your honors.
mr.
adama?
mr.
adama!
yes.
why do you believe that the defendant, gaius baltar, deserves to be acquitted?
well, because the evidence does not support the charges.
come on.
did the defendant make mistakes?
sure, he did.
serious mistakes.
but did he actually commit any crimes?
did he commit treason?
no.
i mean, it was an impossible situation.
when the cylons arrived, what could he possibly do? what could anyone have done?
i mean, ask yourself, what would you have done?
what would you have done?
if he had refused to surrender, the cylons would've probably nuked the planet right then and there.
so did he appear to cooperate with the cylons?
sure.
so did hundreds of others.
what's the difference between him and them? the president issued a blanket pardon.
they were all forgiven.
no questions asked.
colonel tigh.
colonel tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people.
forgiven.
lieutenant agathon and chief tyrol.
they murdered an officer on the pegasus.
forgiven.
the admiral the admiral instituted a military coup d'etat against the president.
forgiven.
and me? well, where do i begin?
i shot down a civilian passenger ship.
the olympic carrier.
over a thousand people on board.
forgiven.
i raised my weapon to a superior officer, committed an act of mutiny.
forgiven.
and then on the very day when baltar surrendered to those cylons, i, as commander of pegasus, jumped away.
i left everybody on that planet alone, undefended, for months!
i even tried to persuade the admiral never to return.
to abandon you all there for good.
if i'd had my way, nobody would've made it off that planet.
i'm the coward.
i'm the traitor.
i'm forgiven.
i'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.
we make our own laws now, our own justice.
we've been pretty creative at finding ways to let people off the hook for everything from theft to murder.
and we've had to be. because because we're not a civilization anymore.
we are a gang.
and we're on the run.
and we have to fight to survive.
we have to break rules.
we have to bend laws.
we have to improvise.
but not this time, no.
not this time.
not for gaius baltar.
no, you you have to die.
you have to die, because well, because we don't like you very much.
because you're arrogant.
because you're weak.
because you're a coward.
and we the mob, we want to throw you out the airlock 'cause you didn't stand up to the cylons and get yourself killed in the process.
that's justice now.
you should've been killed back on new caprica.
but since you had the temerity to live, we're gonna execute you now.
that's justice!
no, no.
order order!
this case this case is built on emotion.
on anger bitterness, vengeance.
but most of all, it is built on shame.
it's about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet.
and it's about the guilt of those of us who ran away.
who ran away.
and we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man.
and then flush him out the airlock and hope that that just gets rid of it all.
so that we can live with ourselves.
but that won't work.
that won't work.
that's not justice.
not to me.
not to me.
no further questions.
your honors, i wish to reiterate my strong exception to defense counsel's testimony.
exception noted.
thank you. did you want to cross-examine the witness?
i have no question for defense counsel.
witness is excused.
do you want to call any other witnesses?
your honors, i don't wish to belabor this any longer.
the defense rests.
very well.
this court will adjourn to consider a verdict.
what a glorious moment in jurisprudence.
you did a great job.
all rise.
before i read the verdict, i'd like to make one thing clear.
like everything human, justice is imperfect.
it's flawed.
but it's those very imperfections that separates us from the machines.
and maybe even makes us a species worth saving.
the defendant will rise.
gaius baltar after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal, in a vote of tree to two finds you not guilty.
you won.
good job.
let's go.
i always knew that i was going to be acquitted, but the fact i have been found innocent shouldn't disguise that this trial has been a total pantomime!
assassin!
admiral, you gotta get him out of here!
get him back.
get him out of here!
get him away!
i knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate the sheer what's the word i'm looking for?
hypocrisy.
hypocrisy is the word i'm looking for.
hypocrisy of the prosecution's case, then really, the judges had no other option but to find me not guilty.
your boundless confidence provided with great solace throughout proceedings.
look, i want to thank you both.
truly.
from the bottom of my heart, i am very, very grateful for all you've done.
on a personal note, if i could've seen the admiral squirm just a bit more, it wouldn't have hurt.
now you listen.
don't push it, doctor.
fine.
romo, perhaps we can have a chat.
i've thought about maybe doing a book tour around the fleet.
and there's the publishing rights.
there are issues about my security, where i will live, what i will do.
since we've forged this great relationship during the trial, i thought, you know, who better to think about actually, now that the fleet's legal system is in place, my not-so-inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere.
so i'm afraid this is the end of our journey.
wait a minute, what what about me? wait a minute, wait, please.
think about this for a second.
where will i live?
what am i gonna do? how am i going to survive?
much as i hate to use a cat metaphor, doctor i think you'll land on your feet.
close the door on your way out.
romo, one thing.
when you put me on the stand, did you know what was gonna happen?
i knew you were a honest man, mr.
adama.
much unlike your grandfather.
gaius baltar is innocent.
just the sound of that makes my skin crawl.
not guilty is not the same as innocent.
it must've been particularly difficult for you.
what, you just couldn't get the other two guys to budge?
you voted for his acquittal, didn't you?
i hate to say it.
defense made their case.
the prosecution didn't.
gaius baltar is a traitor.
we both know that.
regardless of the outcome of this trial.
no one's asking anyone to forget.
or to forgive.
but we have to look to the future.
mr.
gaeta.
yes, sir.
commence jump prep.
we're going to the ionian nebula.
yes, sir.
excuse me.
jump coordinates have been distributed, sir.
all fleet ships show green for jump formation delta.
initiate jump.
aye, sir.
jum in three, two, one, jump.
jump complete.
all fleet ships reporting in, sir.
very well, mr.
gaeta.
commence dradis scan.
let's see what's out there.
sitrep!
our sensors show major power fluctuations!
checking on fleet.
s!
two feet over!
nuggets on me! nuggets on me! grab a flashlight and turn it on!
check auxiliary power.
we have negative auxiliary power.
we're on batteries only.
get ready for an engine restart.
dc6 needs to get down there and muster right away.
gaius.
it's okay.
come with me.
where are you taking me to? to your new life.
here.
come on.
come on.
let's get the power back up.
move it around, you know what to do.
there must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief.
there's too much confusion, i can't get no relief.
chief.
this isn't happening.
please, tell me this isn't happening.
so that's it.
after all this time.
a switch goes off, just like that.
oh, no way.
i don't believe this.
i'm not buying this.
this is a this is a trick.
come on!
we're not what is it?
this song that i all right, that's enough, godsdamn it!
deadbolt that frakkin' door! two wars combat.
locked in that dungeon on new caprica.
ellen.
my gods.
what about ellen?
no, no, no.
not after all this.
not after the resistance.
and the occupation.
and after watching my friends die one after another for frakking this? sam.
you stay the hell away from me.
you all just stay the frak away from me.
sam it's true.
we're cylons.
and we have been from the start.
admiral, what's going on?
some kind of power surge.
give me a damage report immediately.
the power outage was fleet-wide, admiral.
it was also simultaneously restored to all ships.
admiral, admiral!
dradis contact!
massive cylon fleet on intercept course!
mr.
gaeta, sound action stations immediately.
i want an emergency jump of the entire fleet.
sir, all fleet ships were powered down during the outage.
it'll take at least 20 min.
to spool up the ftl drives.
we just don't have 20 minutes.
action stations, action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship.
this is not a drill.
all viper pilots report to vipers immediately.
inbound cylon fleet.
i repeat, action stations, action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship.
this is not a drill.
gods.
what are we gonna do? the ship is under attack.
we do our jobs.
report to your stations!
report to stations?
my name is saul tigh.
i am an officer in the colonial fleet.
whatever else i am whatever else it means, that's the man i want to be. and if i die today, that's the man i'll be.
i can't do my job until i have my raptor.
well, get in where the hell have you been?! i'll tell you later.
get that bird in the tube!
get those steps off, come on!
come on, everybody, we're under attack!
let's go, let's go! get her in the viper, hurry!
arm and load all nuclear weapons.
yes, sir.
it's good to see you, colonel.
good to be here, admiral.
you can count on me.
i've never doubted it.
i'm here if you need me, madam president.
alert vipers are away.
who's in viper 3? galactica, apollo.
i'm in viper 3. i have a bogey at my ten.
i'm gonna go check it out.
where'd he go?
where the frak did you go? what the frak?! hi, lee.
kara?
don't freak out. it really is me.
it's gonna be okay.
i've been to earth.
i know where it is.
and i'm gonna take us there.
see you on the 4th season!!!
previously on battlestar galactica you must be- hi, i'm- lee.
yeah.
a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
nice.
never stole his girlfriend.
mm-hmm.
he's a really bad liar right here.
there's been a terrible accident.
your sisters and your father were all killed.
how about you, love?
bet you charge a lot more than that, eh? shut your filthy mouth.
stop being so disgusting.
this is your father, gaius.
i found your father a new place to live. the last time i saw him, he seemed happy.
hera! bill, i've been having that dream again.
unh.
if that's me lying there, than what am i? she took these from her own the blood on these dog tags is 100% proof positive match for one kara thrace.
and you think there's some kind of meaning in these musical notes.
i'm just gro mostly.
looking for patterns, trying to see what comes to me.
she's a half-human, half-machine object of curiosity that holds the key to our continued existence somewhere in her genetic code.
so let's get a tube in her and get her ready.
based on the coordinates we have determined that the cylon colony is located here.
the colony's bound within the gravity well of the black hole, but maintains a stable orbit.
this right here is our only parking spot.
point blank range.
leave only one way then make it impossible to get past the gates.
let's get to work.
can i have your attention, please.
i'm going to be asking for volunteers in the rescue of the child hera.
there is a line running down this deck.
volunteers, move to the starboard side.
everyone else, to the port.
more than 30 on picon! this ain't picon.
ah, right, you got me there.
this ain't picon.
all right.
40.
show him a good time!
i don't want a lap dance, okay?
try it!
you'll like it!
keep the 40. he deserves it.
thank you. so, are you gonna take the job or not?
maybe i should just do it.
i'm letting my pride get in the way.
now you're talkin'.
i mean, who cares? it's one hour of your time, and then you have a whole new life!
a life without midnight watches, or drills, or fleet politics, or the inspections, or any of that crap.
life!
you could be here every night! he won't be here every night.
can hardly get him here once.
to retirement?
what do you say? to retirement.
yay! yes! mmm! yeeeaaah!
if you don't participate in the political conversation, then you are giving up your voice.
you're giving up your right to have a say in the way that our society is run.
what?
you have really bought into all that crap, haven't you? i do.
proudly.
mm-hmm.
and so do you, by the way.
oh, really?
yeah.
'cause that's what the uniform stands for.
it's what we train to defend.
oh, you didn't.
it's true!
no.
no, no, no.
that's sad.
that's sad.
it's cute, but it's sad.
lemme guess.
he's going on about voting and it's importance to a democratic way of life again.
so, you were listening.
you didn't tell me that your brother was an idealistic dreamer.
dreamer.
it's sad.
truth is, he's not.
beneath that romantic exterior lies the heart of a true cynic.
oh, really?
ahh! things are looking up.
this is gonna be fascinating.
yeah, it's one of the many, many, many reasons that him and dad aren't on speaking terms anymore.
oh, come on.
family angst syndrome, i love it.
come on, boys.
let's open up some old wounds.
no, let's not.
dad believes in the system.
believes in the uniform.
believes in something greater than himself.
correction, dad believes in himself.
his uniform, his system, his way of life.
and if you're not with him in that tiny, little bubble, then you might as well not exist.
if you hate him so much, why'd you follow in his footsteps?
oh.
touche.
service gave me four years of college.
i gave the service four years in return.
simple as that.
see? a cynic.
right through to that big, empty space that used to hold his heart.
honey, i think i'm starting to like your brother.
you must be sean.
uh, yeah, i must be.
i hope so.
i'll take these.
they're beautiful, thank you. you're welcome.
do you like white wine?
i do.
kinda awkward, huh? blind date and all?
no, it's not, really.
it's just that i- i have this feeling.
that i know you.
oh? mm-hmm.
really?
mm-hmm.
there you go, sean.
thank you. welcome.
oh, wait a minute.
you were one of my students.
yeah, guilty as charged.
i mean, as soon as marcie mentioned your name i knew, but i didn't wanna tell her. and you knew i was old enough to be your- teacher?
yeah.
but i graduated.
some time ago.
should i go? did i say you should go?
i didn't say you should go.
the night's young.
apparently so are you.
let's see what happens.
sean allison.
you wouldn't do it.
for that kind of money?
you're gods damn right i would.
no, you wouldn't.
look me in the eye and tell me that you'd do it.
that you'd do it for a civilian desk job.
i wanna hear it come outta your mouth.
say it!
i frakkin' knew it.
yeah! i love you guys.
'cause you guys are my family.
whoa.
oh, my gods.
oh, my gods.
come on.
i love you, brother.
come on, big boy.
legs.
all right.
in you go.
you want out? yes, please.
thank you. well, he, uh- he never could hold his liquor.
unlike his brother.
hey, i'm still standing.
which means it's time for shots.
ugh.
there's no need to torture yourself, gaius.
just trust in god's plan for you.
what is god's plan for me? well, you're following it right now.
am i? by taking charge of mankind's remnants, and guiding them to their end.
end of what?
gaius.
we're ready to go.
five seconds, paulla.
okay.
i'm just-hmm.
i'm leaving ishay enough for two more rounds of injections.
that should keep you on your feet for another 48 hours.
two days.
okay.
that-that's- should be enough.
you're using up the last little bit of life you got.
you realize that, don'tcha?
yes.
you've made that clear to me several times.
mm-hmm.
right.
that's it.
we're done.
thank you. thank you. and, uh thank you, doctor.
i'm just doing my job.
un-uh.
no.
you've done much more than that.
you've taken a patient who should've died years ago, and you've given her a chance despite cancer, and the cylons, and her own obstinate nature.
and you've you've given me the little time i have left, and for that you- aou have my- my heartfelt gratitude and my thanks.
well, i-i i don't know what to say.
no, no, don't, don't.
don't spoil your image, just light a cigarette and go and grumble.
your patient now, ishay.
ishay, i i- i can barely see straight.
i'm not surprised.
you're so pumped full of drugs you could float off this bed.
okay.
two days?
all right, two days.
the plan's just starting to take shape, but one thing's clear.
raptors get the toughest job, as usual.
this will require some special piloting skills, and i mean special.
threading a needle while you're on a rollercoaster special.
while it seems a little redundant at this point, the word's come down that it's a volunteer assignment so heh.
that's my raptor wranglers.
always looking for new and interesting ways to get killed.
i'm not gonna lie to you, boys, we are thin on intel on this one.
but the cylons believe that the most logical place for cavil to have taken the girl is deep into the interior of the colony.
best guess.
right here.
we'll be in too close for nukes.
same thing goes for missiles.
now this gonna be strictly a gun battle.
like two old ships on the line, slugging it out at point-blank range.
i want the gun captains to do their job and start  immediately.
and to continue to fire until they run outta ammo.
then i want them to start throwing rocks.
they're gonna have every gun trained directly on us as soon as we jump in.
if we have any shot at this, we're gonna have to interrupt their fire control systems.
and just how the hell is sam supposed to help with that?
if we can plug him into galactica's dradis, ftl, and c-3 systems, his mind should then be able to directly communicate with the colony's hybrids once we jump in.
theoretically, his mind should still be able to control their commands and slow down their response time.
okay.
let's do it, i guess.
there's a catch.
routing hardware connections from all those systems all over the ship into this room is gonna take weeks.
it's a lot easier, faster, if we just move him to the existing lines.
okay, where's that?
well, best place is the cic.
i need someone to lead this fleet who i trust, who demands universal respect.
so the baseship and the fleet are yours.
thank you, sir.
i won't let you down.
i know you won't.
i'll see you at the rendezvous.
if we're not there in 12 hours, we won't be comin'.
yes, sir.
good hunting, sir.
thank you, admiral hoshi.
still not too late to flush them all out the airlock.
take too much time.
i suppose this is what you could call poetic justice.
or what goes around comes around.
either way, congratulations, mr.
president.
thank you, mr.
adama.
and the best of luck.
admiral hoshi, sir.
sir.
um, the sir is right.
good luck.
you too, sir.
president of the colonies, admiral of the fleet, departing.
all right, last raptor out, people! last raptor out! anyone left behind, your ass belongs to us! oh, great.
can we tuck this in there?
listen, i'm not coming with you.
gaius, no, please.
i made up my mind.
gaius, our people need you.
i don't belong to you, paulla.
i never belonged to you.
you appropriated me.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry if i led you to believe they're all yours, now, paulla, enjoy them.
pilot, you have your passengers.
gaius, don't do this.
maybe i'll see you in the next life.
doctor.
and our vipers are ready to take over cap duties for the fleet.
roger that, baseship, you have the cap.
safe journey.
godspeed, galactica.
let's go around the horn.
this is the xo.
all combat stations prepare to report.
ftl.
go.
we'll set up triage here.
just prep the table the way that i do.
weapons.
go.
separate out the wounded.
those we can save, and those we can't.
engineering.
go.
how will i know?
take this marker.
put an on the forehead of those who are too badly hurt.
you'll know when you see them.
main battery.
go.
engine room.
go.
we're next.
sick bay.
sick bay's a go.
viper wing.
go.
assault one.
go.
assault two.
go.
reserve force.
go.
com 1. go.
sorry.
caprica.
com 2. go.
what're you doing here?
what- i don't think you should be here.
probably been in more battles than you have.
fair point.
life support.
emergency system standing by.
yeah, i suppose a more pertinent question is what am i doing here?
what the hell was i thinking?
secure blast doors ellen.
i think we're a go up here.
all stations report, sir.
connect me just to the ship.
this is the admiral.
just so there'll be no misunderstandings later galactica's seen a lot of history.
gone through a lot of battles.
this will be her last.
she will not fail us if we do not fail her. if we succeed in our mission, galactica will bring us home.
if we don't it doesn't matter anyway.
action, stations.
start the clock.
jump on my mark.
five, four, three, two, one, mark.
we can't take much of this.
it's time, sam.
look through the eye just with thyself.
ahh. the colony hybrids are offline.
they'll be launching raiders any minute.
launch all wings.
birds are away.
all ahead, flank speed!
three, two, one, hit it!
all hands brace for impact.
assault one, stand by.
ah! here they come, let's take 'em! light it up.
assault team on me.
let's do this.
go.
get out there.
pressure.
we've got pressure, sir.
one atmosphere.
assault one, we got pressure.
alpha team, helmets off.
move out.
think we lost cartwheel.
dradis is almost useless out here.
yeah, i hope that works both ways.
any sign they spotted our approach?
i haven't looked at the instruments in a while.
i don't think you want me to start now.
maybe not.
let's go weapons hot, skulls.
we're gettin' close.
sure about that?
no.
but i don't wanna come outta this crap with cold weapons, either.
nukes are hot.
you know, this reminds me of that time back during landing qual, huh? battery three, redirect your fire! ten degrees starboard!
concentrate on taking out the cylon batteries!
hotdog and ladykiller, concentrate on taking out cylon raiders coming in at 084 carom 229.
tally, galactica.
we got 'em.
we have a hard seal.
go.
you're gonna just keep doing the tests.
even with the colony coming down around your ears?
i think you overestimate their chances.
they may have confused our hybrids temporarily, but we have superior fire power and superior numbers.
and in the end it's all about mathematics.
ah! sam! sam, listen to me.
you're pushing too much energy through the acs.
you gotta back off.
you're gonna blow the main bus.
you hear me? sam! there are secrets within the eyes, answers within riddles.
lay off the acs? you betcha, galen.
open your mind and hear what your heart wants to deny.
end of line.
you never should've trusted her.
trust didn't enter into it.
i simply miscalculated her need to engage in gestures of futility.
we have to assume that she'll try to make contact with the colonial forces aboard the colony.
it's time to go on the offensive.
we must be cautious.
to much force could risk killing the child.
really?
ya think?
please continue stating the perfectly obvious.
it fills me with confidence.
i'm proud of you.
what? for doing this.
for being here when you coulda just walked away.
i don't think i ever said it before, but i always wanted to be proud of you.
guess i always felt that was the only thing missing.
all the pieces are falling into place.
you will hold the future of cylons and humans in your hands.
i will?
you see them? reconnect me! cylons just blew a hole into deck 21! frakkin' centurions'll be pouring in at platoon strength!
on me, let's move!
wait.
tell the old man i owed him one.
doesn't change anything you did, though.
no.
we all make our choices.
today i made a choice.
i think it's my last one.
all right, this is really touching.
can we get the hell outta here?
you should know that your raptor's been destroyed.
you can't go back that way.
yeah, well, that's not the plan.
ah, can we not tell her the plan?
right.
missed the trap seven times in two days.
it's a new galactic record.
regs say that you've washed out, rook.
time to look for a new career.
what do you want me to do, sir? do you want me to beg for my billet?
do you want me to crawl?
i want you to land your frakkin' bird without diggin' holes into my deck.
how's that, huh? how 'bout being a pilot?
an officer worthy of the uniform.
take your job seriously.
don't let your personal life get in the way.
i've read your jacket.
your whole story.
i know that your family's gone, and i know that you have no home.
all you got is the service.
and it's slowly slippin' away.
you're trying to find a way to wash yourself out. the doctor's in.
check your neuroses at the door.
lotta people have died on this ship.
there's a lotta ghosts running around here.
you don't wanna pull them into your cockpit with you.
because you won't come back alive.
do you understand that?
yes, sir.
i don't think you do, but maybe someday you will.
as for now make the trap tomorrow, rook.
dismissed.
thank you, sir.
i owe you one.
you and a lot of other people owe me one, but you know what, very few people ever pay back.
especially the ones that owe you their lives.
i'll pay you back one day, sir.
when it really means something.
you do that.
okay, get this guy cross-checked and set me up a large-bore iv.
i need a set of wipers on this marine over here, and a ct scan over here on this one.
and get him the frak out of here!
it's all right.
you've gonna be all right.
he's gone.
all right, you'll be- you're gonna be all right.
okay.
what took you so long?
stopped for coffee.
how many other raptor teams made it?
haven't seen anybody else.
okay, back the way we came.
guns.
point.
we're retracing our steps.
say again, apollo!
i cannot copy your last transmission!
this is the xo.
red stripes to repel boarders.
deck 21, portside, frame 10. we got the prize!
repeat, we have the prize!
formed up with assault two and are heading back to base.
roger that!
eta five minutes.
actual out.
fire! we got a fire up here!
connect me to command unit!
yes, sir! move reserved forces to  airlock.
assault force is en route.
eta five minutes.
i repeat, eta five minutes.
we're friendly!
hold your fire! friendlies!
rangel, peters, form up! sorry 'bout that.
doc, you did good.
thank you. we'll take hera.
right.
come on.
come on, bring hera.
get him outta here, get him outta here.
fall back, fall back!
what?
hera.
clear!
oh, god! hera! hera, come back here!
hera! look at me! go.
no, you'll bleed out.
go! okay.
no.
i'm empty.
two rounds.
hera! hera! i've been here before.
yes.
we're-we're supposed to go into the opera house.
this one's still alive!
get him the hell outta here!
they got the girl.
they've got the little girl! this makes it a lot easier.
i just take the little girl and i'm outta here.
not a chance.
cavil, we won't let you take hera.
you know that.
i know nothing of the kind.
i know i'm gonna watch you chase your tails across the universe for another four years.
that's not gonna happen.
this thing is the key to my people's survival and i'm not leaving without it.
hera's not a thing.
she's a child.
and she holds the key to humanity's survival as well.
and how do you know that?
i see angels.
angels in this very room.
now i may be mad.
but that doesn't mean that i'm not right.
because there's another force at work here.
there always has been.
it's undeniable.
we've all experienced it.
everyone in this room has witnessed events that they can't fathom, let alone explain away by rational means.
puzzles deciphered in prophecy.
dreams given to a chosen few.
our loved ones dead.
risen.
whether we wanna call that god or gods or some sublime inspiration or a divine force that we can't know or understand, it doesn't matter- it doesn't matter.
it's here.
it exists.
and our two destinies are entwined in its force.
if that were true- and that's a big if- how do i know this force has our best interests in mind?
how do you know that god is on your side, doctor?
i don't.
god's not on any one side.
god's a force of nature beyond good and evil.
good and evil, we created those.
and we'll break the cycle.
break the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, destruction, escape, death.
well, that's in our hands and our hands only.
requires a leap of faith.
requires that we live in hope not fear.
if i leave you this girl, that means the destruction of my people.
how does our extinction fit into this picture that you want us to believe in? we'll give you resurrection.
saul! you give us hera and we will give you resurrection.
but the war ends here.
you leave humanity in peace and give up the pursuit now and for all time.
agreed.
how do we know we can take your word for it?
you don't.
you have to make a leap of faith.
it's your call, bill.
i'll back you either way.
i'm losing a lot of men out there.
i can do something about that right now.
give me that phone.
patch him through.
hello?
hello, it's me, cavil.
stand down!
all forces cease fire immediately.
galactica, hotdog.
they're pulling back.
repeat.
they're pulling back!
everyone stand down.
i'm as good as my word.
admiral viper wing's aboard.
we lost four birds.
assault force is aboard.
we've lost seven raptors.
what are they doing?
each of them knows part of the secret to resurrection.
they're gonna interact with the dataflow in the water.
and i don't know.
it's a lotta complicated technical talk about sharing the information among the five of them and then transferring it over to the colony somehow.
now, for a moment, we're going to know everything there is to know about one another.
looking forward to that.
there are certain things that that we've all done.
certain things that people would be shocked to learn about.
hey, i don't mean to rush you, but you are kee two civilizations waiting!
let's-let's just all agree that no matter what we learn about each other, we're all cylons, and we're all capable of making mistakes.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're forgiven for all your dark secrets.
let's do this.
any word?
we're getting the data now.
it looks right.
they're downloading the resurrection designs now.
they've broken off the download.
it's a trick!
open fire! frak! we've gotta get outta here!
starbuck, jump the ship!
i don't have the rendezvous coordinates!
doesn't matter!
just jump us out of here now! jump! just trust yourself.
there must be some kind of way out of here.
i thought that if i assign numbers to the notes if that's me lying there, then what am i? when i look at you now, i don't see kara thrace.
i see an angel blazing with the light of god.
angel.
jump! ah.
you're tempting fate.
ah.
mmm.
if i have a fate, then it is set and thinking about it isn't gonna make it happen any faster.
okay, fair enough.
but flying when you're thinking about dying and- it's a bad way of doing business.
you're gonna get scared and you're gonna start second guessing yourself.
i'm not scared.
you said that you think about dying every time that you get into a cockpit.
uh-huh.
well, hello?
yeah, but it doesn't scare me.
like, that's what you don't get.
what, so it's, um, kara thrace, the fearless warrior, right?
dum dum dum dah! no, i-i know- i know fear.
and i get scared.
just- just not of dying.
so then what does scare you? mmm.
sorry.
being forgotten.
you all right?
i am fine.
xo? sir? sitrep.
damage report.
i'm okay.
i'm okay, go.
sir.
we're mostly here.
the engines life support but there's red lines through her lateral structural members.
she's broke her back.
she'll never jump again.
wherever we are is where we're gonna stay.
where have you taken us, kara?
glad you could join us, admiral.
lieutenant hoshi suits me just fine, sir.
admiral stars turned out to be a little heavy.
happiest day of my life when i saw that raptor jump into the rendezvous point.
well, there you have it, admiral.
the most advanced civilization we could locate on this planet.
i can't see them talking to each other.
so either they communicate a different way or they're pre-verbal.
judging by the look of their tools, which are rudimentary to say the least, i'd suggest that we've found an early, ritualistic, tribal society.
they bury their dead.
i came across a grave a couple of  back and ran some tests.
their dna is compatible with ours.
meaning we can breed with them.
you got a one-track mind, doc.
what?
listen, i'm talking about the survival of the human race, actually.
not some get together with the natives.
you also have no sense of humor.
right.
right, i'm sorry.
how's that possible?
human beings naturally evolved on a planet one million light years away.
the odds against that are- astronomical, yeah.
one might even say there was a divine hand at work.
well, whoever's responsible, we're here.
and here's where we're gonna stay with our new families.
my vote is that we clear everything back to this ridge.
easy access to the water down by the river.
in fact, the whole area's ripe for cultivation.
we should be able to lay out the preliminary lines for a city within a day or two.
no.
no city.
not this time.
what do you propose we do?
we break the cycle.
we leave it all behind and start over.
you're talking about a little over 38,000 people- the entire human race- with nothing but the clothes on their backs and some provisions.
it's not the entire human race.
there are people already here.
tribal.
without language even.
but we can give them that.
i mean, we can give them the- the best part of ourselves.
but not the baggage.
not the ships, the equipment, the technology, the weapons.
if there's one thing that we should've learned, it's that, you know, our brains have always outraced our hearts.
our science charges ahead.
our souls lag behind.
let's start anew.
we'll land civilians at various points around the planet.
our objective will be to spread the people out as much as possible to give them the best possibility of survival.
supplies will be evenly distributed throughout the camps.
and locations will be documented and given to everyone.
i have to say, i'm shocked at how amenable everyone is to this notion.
i would have thought there'd be general uprising at the idea of losing whatever little creature comforts we had left.
don't underestimate the desire for a clean slate, mr.
lampkin.
have you made a decision?
the sixes, the eights, and the twos have decided to stay.
see how we can contribute to the world before we pass into god's hands.
we'll give the baseship to the centurions, let them find their own destiny.
i think they've earned their freedom.
and what if they evolve again on their own and decide to come back in a few hundred years and wipe us out? it's a risk.
but i think setting them free may be enough to break the cycle of violence.
and it's a risk worth taking.
and i agree.
they've earned it.
now once the civilians have been off-loaded, the fleet will leave the orbit and rendezvous with galactica.
the course of the fleet will be plotted into the nav computer ahead of time.
but that actual piloting will be done by mr.
anders.
he'll guide the entire fleet directly into the sun.
i love you.
good-bye sam.
i'll see you on the other side. is your name william adama?
yes.
are you an officer in the colonial fleet?
yes.
are you a cylon?
i'm sorry, bill.
we're still establishing tests for the control.
i need verifiable yeses and nos.
no.
i'm not a cylon.
have you ever stolen money from a cash drawer?
have you ever stolen money- enough of this crap.
take this thing off me right now.
no job is worth this, no matter how fat the paycheck is.
i'd rather spend the rest of my career- what's left of it- on a broken down old ship than have someone sit here and question my word.
perfection.
that's what it's about.
it's those moments when you can feel the perfection of creation the beauty of physics, you know? the wonder of mathematics.
the elation of action and reaction.
and that is the kind of perfection that i wanna be connected to.
you sure this is what you want, galen?
yeah, i'm sure.
just tired of people.
human, cylons, whatever.
last raptor out tomorrow is gonna drop me off on this island that i found off one of the northern continents.
it's cold.
it's up in the highlands.
there's no people.
good luck.
for what it's worth, if what happened to cally had happened to ellen, i'd have done the same frakking thing.
hmm.
hey! ah! i thought bill was coming.
he's taking a leak.
oh, nice.
hey.
order me a drink, honey.
keep 'em coming.
tonight we are celebrating your retirement and all the time i'm about to get to spend with my husband.
mwah! are you good with that?
ugh! saul! all i've ever wanted was to be with you.
not just weekend liberties or two week's leave a year.
i mean full-time.
you and me together in a house, in a tent homeless and on the street.
just be together.
mmm.
excuse me.
don't drop me! to us! yeah! they're so many.
wait, i wanna see more detail.
it's a very beautiful world.
does it have a name?
earth.
it's not earth.
earth is a dream.
one we've been chasing for a long time.
we've earned it.
this is earth.
okay then.
earth.
it's fine.
oh.
i'm-i'm having trouble breathing.
would you like to get a better look at them? yes, i'd l- love it.
i would.
watch.
what?
why? what are you doing?
watch me.
what are you doing?
put your arm around me. can you?
dad? i don't have much time, son.
i understand.
what do you hear, starbuck?
nothing but the rain.
grab your gun and bring in the cat.
you should go.
you know, my very earliest memory of my father was him flying away on a big plane and wondering when he was coming back.
he's not coming back this time.
no, he's not.
neither am i.
where are you going?
i don't know.
i just know that i'm done here.
i've completed my journey and it- it feels good.
you and i right here right now. on the table?
i dare you.
i double-dog dare you.
double-dog dare?
oh, yeah.
double-dog.
all right.
oops.
something's broken.
i guess i better, um, get going.
uh, yeah. it was nice to meet you lee adama.
likewise, kara thrace.
so what about you? what are you gonna do? today is the first day of the rest of your life, lee.
well, um i always thought when this was all done i would, um, uh, kick back.
relax.
spend the rest of my days doing the absolute minimum humanly possible.
and now that you're here?
i want to explore! i wanna climb the mountains.
i wanna cross the oceans.
i wanna gods, i can't believe i'm saying this. it sounds so exhausting.
i must be crazy.
good-bye, kara.
you won't be forgotten.
laura, you okay? hi.
sean, it's been a lovely evening.
really lovely.
uh-huh.
but i'm afraid we won't be doing this again.
uh, did i- no.
no, no, not you.
no, you're wonderful.
come on then- no.
you can show yourself out.
i'm sorry.
wow okay.
hello, this is laura roslin.
i'd like you to give a message to mayor adar.
tell him that i will be joining his campaign.
thank you. all the way to the end.
no matter what.
all the way to the end.
so much life.
it's a rich continent.
more wildlife than all the 12 colonies put together.
just looking for a quiet little place for that cabin.
maybe a garden.
i don't have much of a green thumb, so i hope that you do.
right there.
i'm gonna build it right there, laura.
lot of game on this planet.
i'm a pretty good hunter, you know?
yeah, right.
what are you  at? what? that buck on caprica.
oh, okay, come on now.
that's not fair.
hey, don't you listen to mommy.
daddy is a great hunter.
no, mommy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
no, no, no, no.
real hunting.
no.
yeah.
and i'm gonna teach you how to build a house and how to plant crops.
okay, maybe mommy will teach you that, but daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
hera! hera will she be all right?
she survived.
thanks to you.
both of you.
and that's it?
that's all god wants of us? god's plan is never complete.
great.
but i think it's safe to say that from now on your lives will be less eventful.
i've been thinking.
i may be able to help you out after all.
about that thing you were asking about before.
getting a peek into the defense mainframe.
it would mean a lot to my employers.
yeah, well, i'm not doing it for employers.
i'm doing it for you.
how would it make you feel? i'd be very grateful.
we'll put that to the test.
because if anyone finds out, i could get my head cut off.
so i'll count on your discretion.
the things men do for love.
love?
gaius?
yeah, well you know-you know what i mean, don't you? over there between those two peaks.
i saw some terrain that looked good for cultivation.
cultivation?
yes.
you know, i know about farming.
hey, i know.
i know you do.
i laid out the cabin today.
it's gonna have an easterly view.
you should see the light that we get here.
when the sun comes from behind those mountains it's almost heavenly.
it reminds me of you.
at a scientific conference this week at the smithsonian institution in washington, the startling announcement was made that archeologists believe they have found fossilized remains of a young woman who may actually be mitochondrial eve.
mitochondrial eve is the name scientists have given to the most recent common ancestor for all human beings now living on earth.
she lived in what is now tanzania, over 150,000 years ago.
along with her cylon mother and human father.
commercialism, decadence, technology run amok.
remind you of anything?
take your pick.
kobol, earth-the real earth before this one- caprica before the fall.
all of this has happened before- but the question remains.
does all of this have to happen again?
this time, i bet no.
you know, i've never known you to play the optimist.
why the change of heart?
mathematics, law of averages.
let a complex system repeat itself long enough, eventually something surprising might occur.
that too is in god's plan.
you know it doesn't like that name.
silly me.
silly, silly me. said the joker to the thief # there's too much confusion # i can't get no relief # business men, they drink my wine # plow man dig my earth # none will level on the line # nobody of it is worth #.
